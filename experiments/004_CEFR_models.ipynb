For example, most top level positions of many jobs are still dominated by men and there are glass ceilings in these workplaces. Besides, workforce participation of women is still very low with around 24% according to national statistics institution. By the way many in-house jobs, such as child caring,cooking,cleaning etc., are being done by women and this is also a matter of our traditions. On the other hand, in past few years there have been many developments on this issue. For instance there have been many provisions concerning gender equality in law.
