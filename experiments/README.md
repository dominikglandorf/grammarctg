# Experiments

Please find a short description of the experiments in this directory.

1. Annotate grammar in a list of dialog turns using the rule-based POLKE annotator.
2. Annotate a text with POLKE and test whether POLKE can detect example sentences from the English Grammar Profile.
3. Find grammar skills with rules on dependency-parsed and POS-tagged corpus sentences.
4. Make a language model write/speak like a learner on a CEFR level.
5. Evaluate legacy grammar detectors (multi-task training on synthetic data).
6. Generate examples for grammar skills with GPT-3.5 and indicate important words.
7. Find a simple but powerful grammar skill detection architecture.
8. Preprocess and describe dialogue datasets.
9. Improve synthetic data generation with frequency analysis and adversarial examples.
10. Evaluate grammar detection from synthetic data.
11. Evaluate grammar detection from manually curated data.
12. Evaluate grammar detection from automatically curated data.
13. Find suitable prompts for subtasks of grammar-controlled response generation.
14. Set up evaluation metrics for constraint satisfaction and response quality.
15. Generate test cases for the subtasks.
16. Analyze generated dialog responses for the subtasks.
17. Plot baseline frequencies of grammar skills.
18. Implement instruction fine-tuning for grammar-controlled response generation.
19. Implement guided decoding for grammar-controlled response generation.
20. Simulate how grammar-controlled responses facilitate grammar practice.
