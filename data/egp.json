Strips, bows, paper-wrapping. Thinking of Christmas? Not necessarily.","645":"Do I agree with this statement?

I bought a white hooded jacket, a blue jumper, black gloves and a beautiful blue scarf. \n\nInside there were three samples of a nasty purple liquid. \n\nI know your company are offering an exciting new service in our area. \n\nHe had beautiful green eyes, short, curly, red hair and he was wearing an elegant black suit with a red tie. \n\nYou can walk along the streets and eat typical Spanish food in good restaurants.","657":"It took us a very long time but it was a great fun! \n\nThey made really good friends.","658":"It was so terrible because I've never been in such a terrible situation. \n\nSo it was really funny to hear from her after such a long time. \n\nThank you for giving me such a fantastic birthday present. \n\nAlso, we both liked to read and that was why we were such good friends. \n\nI had never worn such high heels before.","659":"It was a beautiful red dress with blue flowers on the back. \n\nYesterday a TV company came to our school to make a film about Bavarian pupils. \n\nI don't spend too much time in front of the television, I just watch it twice a week and on Sundays morning. \n\nI received your letter and you asked me about the future of my town. \n\nI have to travel to Montevideo to see my doctor because I'm having some problems with my health.","660":"It has the best promenade I have seen. \n\nThe best book I've read is \"The Da Vinci code\". \n\nIt was the best decision you had ever made. \n\nWe enjoy going shopping, walking and talking hour after hour - She's the funniest person I've ever known!","661":"Last week I left my clothes at the dry cleaner's and I can't collect them. \n\nI have to go to the dentist\u2019s. \n\nI'll be picking you up at eight o'clock near the McDonald's, OK? \n\nI'm going to be absent from the English class next week, because I am going to the doctor's. \n\nIt's next to your grandma's.","662":"\u2026 we always did everything together and couldn't stop laughing as she told me many funny stories and I told her lots of silly mistakes of mine. \n\nA colleague of mine has told me about a Swiss hotel in London. \n\nI was looking for something special to do for my last week off and some schoolmates of mine invited me to join the cycling holiday. \n\nI'm a fan of his, he is my favorite singer. \n\nI want this dream of mine to come true.","663":"He is a friend of my husband. \n\nI just thought they were friends of my neighbour who were going to visit him.","664":"I ran to the street and I saw the window of my neighbour's car was broken. \n\nThe subject of my boss's talk will be IT skills. \n\nMy friend Ronald had been chosen to play the role of James Bond's son! \n\nMy best friend is called Sindi and we met at my brother's birthday.

Working late is not the solution and it is even dangerous. \n\nAlso, think about stress. Driving in a city is stressful. \n\nFirst of all, Wicklow Mountains Centre is the perfect place for climbing. Climbing is our favourite hobby and, I think, we will have a good time. \n\nMany people say that they just don't have time for thinking about their health. Living in today's world demands spending a lot of time working.","682":"Learning English has its rewards too. \n\nAdvertising seems to be very important to promote a new product. \n\nTeaching is terribly challenging and demanding.","683":"We play computer games. \n\nYou have to walk just 5 minutes down the road. \n\nMy favourite season is  summer, because it's very hot and there are a lot of flowers and nice trees.","684":"The art classes after school are on Tuesdays. \n\nThen I bought five different dresses. \n\nYou have to bring your pencil, oil paint, some paint brushes, and the teacher will give you a palette. \n\nUsually it is meat and potatoes or special dishes. \n\nBring some sandwiches and drinks. \n\nA box of Dairy milk and 2 boxes of pens. \n\nWe have to bring paintbrushes of different sizes ?","685":"I have a lot of hobbies. \n\nThere were lots of activities to do. \n\nI bought some jeans and costumes because I have a lot of parties this month.","686":"It was a sale and I bought some clothes for my children. \n\nI ate fish and seafood, it was delicious. \n\nShe has black eyes, a beautiful round face and nice teeth. \n\nThe floor in the kitchen has many holes and I think there are mice.","687":"I bought them because I feel comfortable when I am wearing these clothes. \n\nThe clothes are very cheap in this shop. \n\nThe jeans were expensive, but the other things were very cheap. \n\nPlease wear some shorts and a shirt. \n\nI left my glasses in your house last night.

that we would like to offer a 10% discount provided you reserve office space for eighteen months. \n\nProviding we implement the suggested actions I believe we can increase sales within the next six months, overcoming the current situation caused by the international situation. \n\nI would suggest that you might bring a city map in case you lose your way.","1119":"All this could have been avoided, if the plan had been more flexible. \n\nSeveral statements in the newspaper could have been avoided, if the writer had taken notice of the income results which were sent along with the other facts from the charity day. \n\nHowever, I think I could have learned more if more individual tuition had been available. \n\nI wrote this article referring to my own experience in London, hence I might have had a different opinion if I had gone to another city or country.","1120":"Furthermore I found little rooms where an employee could take a short nap if needed. \n\nMeals are served, if

car.","1125":"Were I to win this travel scholarship, the country of my choice would be Japan. \n\nWere you to compare people's views on animals to their views on food, you would find many similarities. \n\nWere someone to decide that he did not want to go to university, he would have to face the consequences of his choice. \n\nWere this suggestion to be put into practice, our town's personality would change completely from a small town to a port of call for a large number of visitors.","1126":"As a matter of fact, education is free and as a result they can attend whichever university they desire so long as they have the proper qualifications, of course. \n\nI was allowed to bring my friends home and go out with them on condition that my parents knew where I was and when I was going to return.","1127":"Were it not for my university, I would give up this class immediately. \n\nWere it not for that kind of toy, children would be able to gain more team-spirit, creativity

number of commuters will need a lot of planning and a very good infrastructure if it were to succeed.","1130":"Whether or not the visitors should imitate local customs and behaviour is definitely a debatable issue. \n\nWhether or not it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools has been a widely discussed issue in recent years. \n\nWhether or not richer countries should help these poor nations is a very controversial issue, there are people on both sides of the argument who have very strong feelings. \n\nHowever, it depends only on the children whether or not they'll go to a university and there are many factors to be considered before deciding on going.","1131":"I can't come to your wedding because, as you know, I live in England and on Thursday 18th July I'm going to

Am I alone?\" I asked. \n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked.","1150":"She asked me to come back as soon as possible because my father is seriously ill. \n\nAs the concert finished, I heard someone call my name, I turned and there were two men from security who asked me to go up on the stage. \n\nDad asked me to help him at work. \n\nHe told me to go outside the concert hall and wait for him to come. \n\nI have caught a cold and my doctors told me to rest in bed for a few days. \n\nThey told me to stay in the car and watch them and try to remember their faces.","1151":"At the airport they told him to come the next morning. \n\nThe trainer was impressed and said that if I play next time as well as this time, I'll be the 'pointing guard' in the team. \n\nThe letter said that he is coming home next month. \n\nHer husband told me that the following day they would return to Germany so that was the last time I saw Sara.","1152":"\"No problem\", I thought, \"there is only one person\". \n\n\"We have come together\", this man said, \"to celebrate our annual meeting and to call our master's ghost tonight!? \n\n\"No problem\", I thought, \"there is only one person\". \n\n\"Forgive me, sweetheart\", he said, \"I will never leave you alone again.?","1153":"\"I was astonished when I saw them standing there\", said John. \n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Peter. \n\n\"Would you mind lending me a part of your newspaper?\" said a whispering voice. \n\nWhat do you think about this? said the Inspector to the policeman.","1154":"\"So this is a real cow, mom?\" she asked doubtfully. \n\n\"A hundred dollars for one day. Is that a deal?\" her husband said forcefully. \n\n\"Come on, what's wrong?\" Bella asked curiously. \n\n\"Put that light out!\" I shouted calmly.","1155":"Meanwhile, she told me not to be scared but the place was very... old. \n\nI told him not to climb the wall but he was so interested in doing movements that he did not listen to me. \n\nArriving there, my father told me not to go far and to stay near him. \n\nI asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't.","1156":"First of all, your advertisement says that you have got two great nights in a hotel for us. \n\nIt says you are asking for people to help in a summer camp for foreign school children. \n\nFirstly, your advertisement  tells  us that hotel has two great nights in a wonderful 3-star hotel \n\nThe guidebook says that we can get there by train from London.","1157":"I was wondering why I failed. \n\nSo, he was wondering why we didn't have our letters. \n\nI was thinking which of the two would be more interesting, and I prefer to go to \"Can Animals Speak\", since I love them and I have two. So, I want to know how to communicate with them. \n\nWe were wondering what had happened for a few minutes but then we realised that there had been a power cut. \n\nWhile he was thinking how to reply, Jenny took his hand and led him to the school.","1158":"She had told me the previous day that she had something important to tell me. \n\nWe met Daisy at school on the following day and we told her that the previous day we had been at her house; her grandfather had told us that unluckily she wasn't at home. \n\nMy boss had told me the previous day that an important customer was going to visit the company in the morning. \n\nI had told my friends the day before that I expected to get an A!","1159":"In the morning, I go to the beach. \n\nIn my country, the most popular food is Paella, which is a kind of rice with seafood, really tasty. \n\nFrom your house, take the first turning on your left after the roundabout.","1160":"That's my diary, the dearest thing I had. Here I wrote how I felt, what I did, who I met and all my problems. \n\nQuickly I opened the envelope, took out a white piece of paper and started to read. \n\nSuddenly, the door opened. \n\nOutside, it wasn't a sunny day any longer, it was raining a lot.","1161":"It's great that you have got a new job! \n\nIt's true that there are one or two programmes that are interesting or funny, but the rest... they're horrible! \n\nIt's important that you are happy. \n\nIt is really sad that you have to move to a different area.","1162":"The reason I am writing is to suggest a few things about our holidays. \n\nThe reason that I never continued taking lessons is that my school-work became too heavy and the costs of lessons were too expensive for me as a student. \n\nThe place you need is called \"Academiuta\". \n\nThe place we appreciated the most was the Cap Frehel, where nature is still wild and the birds feel at home. \n\nThe place which has impressed me most of all in my life is Abastumani. .","1163":"The reason is I like children, I have experience of looking after disabled people and I like to do things like volunteering. \n\nThe problem is I know myself, I am always late when I have to leave my house so I need a car to go faster. \n\nThe fact is that not all animals are able to deal with this. \n\nThe fact is science needs computers to increase knowledge and businesses need them like the air we breathe. \n\nIt is true that a lot of accidents are caused by cars. The point is that the car itself does not cause the accident. \n\nThe thing is, Alison is an eleven-year-old girl who has been, together with her father, left behind by her mother when she was just three.","1164":"At the end of the day everything is up to you! \n\nAll in all, the activity week was a nice experience for both students and teachers. \n\nAll things considered, I would recommend the third proposal as it seems to me that it covers most of the points the students have been complaining about. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, who does not like such a surprise? \n\nWhen you think about it, can we afford a flat in Central London and still have something left with a basic salary?","1165":"Note the disadvantages of this transfer. \n\nNotice the difference in the salary.
