It's a sport that really brings people together."],"21":["It would have been interesting if they had gone with the awesome button instead of the like button."],"22":["That's interesting, I didn't know that! But I can see why they went with the like button instead, don't you think 'awesome button' would have been a bit too much?"],"23":["Interesting, I had no idea about that! I guess it would have been too much enthusiasm for a simple button."],"24":["That's interesting! I have never actually owned a bird myself, but I do enjoy watching them fly gracefully in the sky."],"25":["That must have been a beautiful experience. Did you teach your parakeet any tricks?"],"26":["That's great! I have never owned a bird myself."],"27":[" NONE of them seem to prioritize modernization when it comes to technology."],"28":["My best friend works for a tech company and she says their equipment is always up-to-date and cutting edge. Don't you think it's important for government systems to keep pace with technology?"],"29":["It's amazing that they are still using such outdated technology in one of the most important government buildings in the country."],"30":["It's true. In fact, my son plays on a local youth team. He loves it and practices every day after school. Soccer has definitely become a big part of his life."],"31":["That's true. If my kids were good at soccer and wanted to play for a different country, I would support whatever decision they made."],"32":["Absolutely, the level of talent in the Women's team is unmatched.  Not only are they skilled on the field, but they are also excellent role models off the field."],"33":["Yes, I have seen it. I liked it a lot. Have you watched it yet?"],"34":["Yes, I have seen it. It's a really interesting movie, isn't it?"],"35":["No, I haven't seen \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Is it really the best movie of the year?"],"36":[" They would definitely have a hard time living with that guilt forever."],"37":["Don't you think they could have gotten caught much earlier?"],"38":["Yeah, it's probably one of the luckiest outcomes for someone who committed such a serious crime."],"39":["Oh yes, her voice is amazing. She is by far one of the best singers in the industry."],"40":["Yes, I have! Her voice is incredible. It would be amazing to see her perform live."],"41":["If you like Idina Menzel, you would love the music in Frozen then. She has an amazing voice."],"42":["I know, it would have been much better if he had just stuck to the original plan."],"43":["Not a very honorable move. Don't you think he could have handled the situation differently?"],"44":["I can't believe how heartless Vector could be, especially towards children."],"45":["My favorite horror movie is \"The Exorcist.\" The special effects and storyline are absolutely chilling!"],"46":["Oh, my favorite has to be \"The Exorcist.\" It's definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Have you seen it?"],"47":["My favorite horror movie is \"The Exorcist\". None of the others I've seen even come close in terms of scare factor and suspense."],"48":["I haven't heard about Samuel L Jackson's golf clause. What would it entail?"],"49":["I did not know he had a golf clause. What is it about?"],"50":["I didn't hear about that golf clause. Don't you find it interesting how many famous people enjoy golfing?"],"51":["Totally, I would definitely talk about movies with you again in the future."],"52":["I wouldn't say it was the best conversation, but it was alright."],"53":["Yes, it was. I would always choose Thor over Loki, though."],"54":["I used to watch a lot of his movies back in the day."],"55":["I'm not a fan of Keanu Reeves, but I'll give it a shot."],"56":["I've always been a fan of Keanu Reeves. He's probably one of the best actors in Hollywood."],"57":["Definitely, but I guess not all good movies get the recognition they deserve."],"58":["I know, it's becoming rare to find a movie with such high ratings these days. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time."],"59":["I agree, it's rare to find a movie with such high ratings. It must be really good."],"60":["Is he one of your favorite actors?"],"61":["He is one of my favorite actors."],"62":["I don't think he's the best actor, but he's definitely one of the most versatile."],"63":["It actually spread to the Middle East after it gained popularity in Europe, fascinatingly enough."],"64":["Yes, chess is considered one of the most strategic games ever created. Each move can have a significant impact on the outcome."],"65":["Chess is actually believed to have originated in India, not the Middle East. It has been played for centuries and is considered one of the best strategy games."],"66":["Would you believe they used to have such strong objections to it, but now it's considered a classic?"],"67":["It really shows how times have changed, doesn't it? People might not always agree, not a paradox of opinions, but at least they can peacefully demonstrate together."],"68":["It's amazing how divisive it's become, from being forbidden to being widely accepted as a classic."],"69":["I didn't like Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff."],"70":["I would say Tom Hardy's performance in \"The Revenant\" was the most impressive."],"71":["I would say that Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was the most captivating, with not only his acting skills on display but also his charisma."],"72":["Wow, really? That's impressive! I mean, dropping out of high school is one thing, but becoming successful in comedy is a whole other level of achievement. Just goes to show that sometimes following your passion can lead to the best outcomes."],"73":["I can't believe Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school! That's by far the most extreme decision someone can make to chase their dreams."],"74":["Wow, I hadn't heard about that! If he dropped out of high school and still managed to become successful, that's really impressive. I wonder if he regrets not finishing his education though."],"75":["Actually, I can't remember the twist at all, but I think it involves time travel."],"76":["The ending of this movie is unlike any I've ever seen before."],"77":["It turns out that the main character was the villain all along, and not the hero!"],"78":["Don't you think it's amazing that Bob Marley's album has had such incredible longevity?"],"79":["Wow, that's impressive. I would have never guessed that \"Legend\" had such a long run on the charts."],"80":["Wow, that's amazing! Bob Marley's \"Legend\" album is definitely one of the most iconic albums of all time. I can't imagine another album staying on the charts for that long."],"81":["Well, none of the other White Houses can compare to the one in Washington DC. It's not just an ordinary residence, it's a symbol of power and history."],"82":["That's true! I wouldn't mind seeing them all though. Each one must have a unique history and architecture worth exploring."],"83":["I don't know about that. Each White House has its own unique history and stories to tell, don't you think?"],"84":["That's interesting. I had no idea that JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents. The fact that those three were the wealthiest presidents in U.S. history is truly fascinating. It just goes to show that wealth and power do not always correlate with success in office."],"85":["That's really interesting! JFK, Washington, and Jefferson are not only some of the wealthiest presidents but also three of the most influential leaders in U.S. history. It's fascinating to see how their legacies still impact the country today."],"86":["MY BEST FRIEND would probably say that JFK was the most charismatic of the three. Don't you think that wealth doesn't necessarily equate to good leadership qualities?"],"87":["If you had a favorite character in the movie, who would it be?"],"88":["That movie is definitely a must-see for anyone looking for a hilarious and action-packed film."],"89":["Would you like to watch the movie with me tonight?"],"90":["Definitely! Tony Stark is one of the most charismatic and complex characters in the Marvel Universe."],"91":["Absolutely, Tony Stark is known for his larger-than-life personality and tendencies. With the way he's written in the comics and on screen, he is undoubtedly the most flamboyant and eccentric superhero in the Marvel universe."],"92":["Definitely. Tony Stark is known for being the most courageous and adventurous Avenger in my opinion."],"93":["It's been great chatting with you too! Take care and have a wonderful day!"],"94":["Reebok must have been desperate, right? Don't you think it's amazing how well Iverson negotiated that deal?"],"95":["Yes, it was a pleasure chatting with you too! We will have to do it again sometime soon!"],"96":["That's unfortunate! The show might have done better if it had premiered in a different time slot."],"97":["That's surprising! It's considered one of the best American sitcoms ever created."],"98":["Really? That's surprising! It was by far one of the most popular sitcoms in the US, showcasing the talent of actors like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis."],"99":["Indeed, it seems like the plot thickens with every new piece of information. Have you thought about contacting the authorities about this?"],"100":["I know, right?! It's like the most exciting thing that's happened in our neighborhood in a long time."],"101":["I would never have thought Jordan was the brightest of all the scammers out there."],"102":["MY BEST FRIEND loves to hear interesting stories about the US senate."],"103":["No, I'm not very busy at the moment. That's interesting, I didn't know there was a candy desk in the US senate since 1968."],"104":["Wow, that's incredible! I would never have thought that there is a candy desk in the US Senate."],"105":["Wow, that's really interesting! My best friend also loves reading fiction."],"106":["Wow, that's really interesting! Sounds like she was a great teacher. President Andrew Johnson must have been one of the most determined individuals in history."],"107":["Wow, that's impressive! Not a lot of people can say they've never attended school and still became successful."],"108":["Definitely, if they modernized the animation, the characters would look much more realistic."],"109":["That's true. I think Toy Story 2 had some of the best animation of its time. Like, the details in the backgrounds were amazing."],"110":["Oh, really? I don't find the animation creepy at all. Don't you think it's actually quite impressive for its time?"],"111":["I would argue it's one of the best of all time, wouldn't you say?"],"112":["Absolutely, it's not A movie you can forget easily! Don't you think it's one of the most touching films of all time?"],"113":["Do you think it's the best movie of all time?"],"114":["Wow, I can't believe they turned down such a huge offer! That was a big mistake."],"115":["That's incredible! My Space really missed out on a huge opportunity there. It's hard to believe they rejected such a massive deal in favor of 75 million dollars."],"116":["If MySpace had accepted the offer, they would have made a huge mistake. Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform now."],"117":["NONE of them evaporate in the sun. Though they are mainly composed of water, they are not completely evaporated by the sun."],"118":["Really? No, I had no idea! That is by far the most bizarre thing I've heard about jellyfish."],"119":["That's not true. Jellyfish can survive outside of the water for a short period of time, but they cannot evaporate in the sun. Did you know that the Portuguese Man o' War is considered the most dangerous jellyfish in the world?"],"120":["That's great to hear, my best friend!"],"121":["That's good to hear. Have you been busy lately?"],"122":["Did you enjoy the party last night?"],"123":["Oh, that's great! Comedy animations are the best for family movie nights."],"124":["I've never seen a funnier comedy animation before."],"125":["That doesn't sound like a bad choice at all."],"126":["That's okay, I understand. Do you like any other type of movies?"],"127":["Ah, I see. Did you think it was well-made though?"],"128":["Oh, really? Well, Dunkirk is one of the best war films I have ever seen. The cinematography and storytelling are absolutely incredible. You should give it a chance."],"129":["I actually don't enjoy watching Loki, I find him quite irritating."],"130":["Oh, definitely! He's one of the most entertaining villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."],"131":["He's definitely one of my favorite Marvel villains."],"132":["I see what you mean, it seems like Kanye would intentionally create controversy to stay relevant. It would be a clever marketing strategy if that was his intention."],"133":["I wouldn't intentionally disrespect someone like that.  It's important to remember that actions have consequences, even if they seem insignificant at the time."],"134":["It's interesting how fame can really change a person. The power and influence it brings can turn even the most humble individuals into egomaniacs. None of them seem to be immune to it."],"135":["That's true, mantis shrimp have by far the most complex color vision of any animal."],"136":["That's right, mantis shrimp have by far the most complex color vision in the animal kingdom."],"137":["That's right, mantis shrimp have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. Don't you find that fascinating?"],"138":["Yes, I used to watch them every year with my family."],"139":["I do watch the Academy Awards, but I'm not a big fan. It's too long and too boring for me."],"140":["Yes, I would watch them every year. It's always been one of the most spectacular events on TV."],"141":["Yeah, I never fully grasped the idea behind using suicide as a means of awakening in that context."],"142":["If we had read the book before watching the movie, do you think we would have understood it better?"],"143":["It was definitely one of the most mind-bending films I have ever seen."],"144":["Would you say that the movie was well-received by critics in general, then?"],"145":["I can't say I disagree with you; I didn't see that coming at all."],"146":["That's true, but I didn't particularly like the ending. Don't you think it was a bit predictable and clich\u00e9?"],"147":["No, he didn't find any Cubs cards from those years. But imagine finding a treasure like that in your own attic!"],"148":["Haha, that's a great idea! He didn't specify, but I bet there were some valuable cards in there! Not only did he find an amazing collection, but he hit the jackpot with those baseball cards!"],"149":["I bet he did! The Cubs have one of the most dedicated fan bases in all of Major League Baseball, none of whom have ever lost faith in their team!"],"150":["I don't think so. It seems like Google is more focused on being a dog-friendly environment rather than allowing dogs to actually come to work."],"151":["I don't think they do. I believe Google has one of the strictest no pets policies in the tech industry."],"152":["I don't think so. I believe they are very strict on that rule."],"153":["I didn't expect that, I thought the reviews would be better."],"154":["If you hadn't told me that, I probably would have watched it."],"155":["I wouldn't say it was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it definitely wasn't the best."],"156":["Really? I had no idea, that's the faintest possibility I could have imagined. Country music seems to have a long history of underrepresentation."],"157":["That's interesting, I didn't know that! I wonder if there will be more inclusion in the future."],"158":["That's surprising, I didn't know that. It's a shame that not all genres of music are equally represented in the hall of fame."],"159":["I would always watch his movies, no matter what genre they are."],"160":["Would you say it's the most captivating movie you've ever seen?"],"161":["Absolutely! I have to say, the cinematography in it is truly captivating. Don't you think so?"],"162":["That's amazing! I can't believe he was so young when he achieved that. It really shows that age is just a number and anyone can accomplish great things."],"163":["Yes, that's impressive! MY BEST FRIEND doesn't even have a college degree and here this guy was getting a PhD at 20. It's hard to believe sometimes how talented people can be."],"164":["None of us can even imagine achieving such a feat at such a young age. It's truly mind-blowing!"],"165":["I agree. It's like a fundamental right. I wish everyone would take advantage of that opportunity to have a say in the government."],"166":["Absolutely. And not taking advantage of that right is a missed opportunity. I never want to be someone who doesn't vote."],"167":["Absolutely, the right to vote is by far one of the most important privileges we have in a democracy. Don't you think it's crucial for everyone to exercise that right? Like, it's such a powerful way to make our voices heard."],"168":["Yes, it's the most captivating and talked-about series on Netflix right now."],"169":[" Yes, it is quite recent. It would definitely be a great choice for a cozy evening in with your husband."],"170":["Yes, it's a fairly recent production, but not all the reviews have been positive."],"171":["Absolutely, I would highly recommend it. The script was also beautifully written."],"172":["None of my friends have seen it yet, but I heard it's one of the best films this year."],"173":["I would not recommend the movie, it's not a masterpiece by any means."],"174":["My worst nightmare! I hope they realize it's wrong."],"175":["Wow, Jordan sounds like the best salesman ever!"],"176":["I wouldn't say that Jordan is the best role model for ethical business practices."],"177":["Yeah, I never really agreed with that decision. Pluto will always be a planet in my eyes."],"178":["That's true, not all celestial bodies are classified as planets anymore. Not only Pluto, but also other objects were affected by the new definition."],"179":["Yeah, it's quite surprising how Pluto went from being a planet to not being one anymore. It's one of the biggest controversies in astronomy."],"180":["That's incredible! UNICEF donating clean water is one of the best initiatives I've heard of."],"181":["That's incredible. By far, UNICEF is the most generous organization with their donations."],"182":["That's incredible! UNICEF really does amazing work in providing clean water. Not only do they help with hydration, but also with overall health and sanitation."],"183":["Wow, that's fascinating! The fact that such critical global communication relies on just a few cables is mind-blowing. I had no idea the scope of international communication was so centralized."],"184":["That's a really fascinating fact! It would be amazing to see those underwater phone lines in action."],"185":["That's true, it's amazing how interconnected the world is in that way. The fact that so much information can travel through those few cables is incredible!"],"186":["I agree! The process of testing and analyzing data must be very detailed and precise. It must have taken the scientists at NASA a lot of trial and error to perfect their methods."],"187":["I wouldn't say they are completely different, you can actually apply similar principles to both planets, just with a few adjustments. It's definitely a fascinating field to work in."],"188":["I wouldn't have imagined that the two planets are so similar in testing conditions, it's fascinating how much we can learn from these missions."],"189":["Iowa Hawkeyes have the most heartwarming tradition with the children's hospital visits. Thank you for recognizing that."],"190":["Well, not all big ten schools have the same impact on their community. The Iowa Hawkeyes' tradition with the children's hospital is truly heartwarming. It's definitely one of the best things in college football."],"191":["Thank you! We are actually ranked as the number one children's hospital by far. Would you ever consider supporting our cause?"],"192":["Not really. Amazon is by far the biggest e-commerce company in the world. Their influence is unmatched in the industry."],"193":["I don't think so. Amazon is probably the most successful online retailer in the world."],"194":["No, it hasn't hurt Amazon's business at all. In fact, they are still the leader in online retail."],"195":["None of Shakespeare's plays have never been adapted to film or television. His works are so timeless and versatile that they have been translated into various forms of media."],"196":["None of his plays have never been adapted to either film or television. And yes, I do enjoy Shakespeare. Would you believe that I've read all of his works?"],"197":["Actually, NONE of Shakespeare's plays have never been adapted to either film or television. They have all been brought to life in some way or another."],"198":["I've never heard of a computer running on water before. It's fascinating to think about the advancements in technology over the years."],"199":["Coding sounds tough, I would constantly make mistakes with all those lines of code to remember."],"200":["It's hard to imagine a computer running on water, quite the innovation for that time period. I wouldn't have thought that was even possible."],"201":["I am not a huge fan of Pokemon, but I have to say, the digital effects used in some of the skits are absolutely mind-blowing!"],"202":["I'm not really a pokemon fan, but I do think their merchandise sales are by far the highest compared to other franchises."],"203":["No, I'm not a Pokemon fan. But I did catch the episode where Alec Baldwin played the role of a mafia boss in the digital short \"The Tony Bennett Show\", it was by far one of the funniest sketches in my opinion."],"204":["Iowa is a good football team, but they have had some ups and downs. I can see why you would prefer Maryland Basketball, they have a great team."],"205":["Iowa is definitely a good football team, not a powerhouse, but they always compete well. Don't you think Maryland Basketball is exciting to watch, though?"],"206":["I wouldn't say Iowa is the best football team, but they have had some good seasons. It would be interesting to see how they do this year."],"207":["It's an interesting book, but it's quite dense. I prefer lighter reads like comic books as well."],"208":["Well, it's not a typical military book, it's more about the philosophical ideas behind war. Don't you find that intriguing?"],"209":["I think it's quite interesting, but not everyone enjoys it. It's considered by far one of the best military science fiction novels out there."],"210":["That's true, not all players feel comfortable using the granny style shot in a game situation."],"211":["That's true, but it can still be effective in certain situations."],"212":["That's true, not all players appreciate the granny style shot even though it is often the most effective."],"213":["Zack Snyder directed it.\nB: Oh, I'm not really a fan of his work. I prefer directors who focus more on character development and storytelling, not just visual effects."],"214":["Zack Snyder directed it. Would you like to watch it sometime?"],"215":["Zack Snyder directed it. He's by far one of the best directors in the superhero genre."],"216":["Yes, that's the one. Georgia Tech scored so many points in that game, it's hard to imagine any team being able to beat them by that much nowadays."],"217":["Yes, that's the one! It's definitely the most one-sided game in the history of college football."],"218":["Yes, that's the one! It's considered one of the worst defeats in college football history. The Georgia Tech team was definitely one of the best."],"219":["Yeah, I have! That game was by far the most lopsided in the history of college football. It's hard to believe the final score was 222-0."],"220":[" No, I haven't! Explain it to me."],"221":["No, I haven't heard of that game. Sounds like it was the worst game ever played!"],"222":["Yeah, it would definitely make for some dramatic television, but in reality, it would be quite unsettling to witness the constant animosity and power struggles between the President and Vice President."],"223":["Yeah, it would definitely be one of the craziest political situations ever! Imagine all the drama and chaos that would unfold, it's probably for the best that things have changed."],"224":["Absolutely, the tension and drama would be off the charts if the runner up became the VP. I wouldn't want to be a part of that situation, not even for all the money in the world."],"225":["No, I never knew that."],"226":["Oh really? I didn't know that. It would be cool to have a shirt from that brand."],"227":["Yeah, I did. In fact, they are popular among athletes for their comfort and style."],"228":["I wasn't surprised at all. It was only natural for them to be celebrated after all they had been through. What do you think?"],"229":["I don't think I would be surprised. I believe the soldiers deserve all the recognition they received."],"230":["I wouldn't say I was surprised, but I do think it was well-deserved. It's great to see our troops being appreciated like that."],"231":["Wouldn't you agree that Wonder Woman always saved the day in the end?"],"232":["You must be the pickiest critic ever! The action scenes are some of the most impressive I've ever seen."],"233":["Yeah, maybe, but she would never let that stop her. Wonder Woman is like the ultimate superhero for situations like this."],"234":["Of course, Hugh Laurie is one of the most famous actors in TV drama. His portrayal of Dr. House is unforgettable."],"235":["No, I have never heard of Hugh Laurie. He might not be as famous as you think."],"236":["Yes, I do. He was the lead in \"House\", right? My best friend never misses an episode of that show."],"237":["I have never been a fan of Linkin Park either. Their music just doesn't appeal to me."],"238":["Neither have I heard that. I never really got into Linkin Park's music."],"239":["Wow, really? I had no idea. I would definitely not have guessed that."],"240":["I would always enjoy talking about interesting topics like this with you. Have a great day!"],"241":["Have a great day!"],"242":["If you'd like, we can discuss more interesting facts next time. Have a great day!"],"243":["King Kalakaua was by far the most well-traveled monarch of his time. His voyages were truly legendary."],"244":["That would be amazing! I'd love to experience different cultures and see all the beautiful places too. Traveling like a king sounds like a dream come true."],"245":["That would be an amazing experience! I can't think of a better way to see the world than by traveling like royalty."],"246":["NONE of their songs really resonate with me. I've never been a fan of their style."],"247":["Yeah, it's hard to say for sure. But it's not a surprise that so many concerts would take a toll on them. It's not a healthy lifestyle."],"248":["I don't think burnout was the reason for his death. Don't you think it was more about personal struggles and inner demons? It's a sad story..."],"249":["No, I didn't."],"250":["I didn't have the faintest idea."],"251":["I wouldn't say I aced it, but I did pretty well."],"252":["See you later as well, have a great day!"],"253":["I had a great time chatting with you."],"254":["See you later, it was nice talking to you."],"255":["I agree, Nintendo was one of the best consoles of its time. The nostalgia of playing games like Super Mario Bros. is unmatched."],"256":["True, it was one of the best consoles made. I would spend hours playing Mario Kart on it."],"257":["That's true, if they still made them, I would definitely buy one."],"258":["Yeah, I guess whoever named Greenland wanted to trick people! But I would still like to visit both Greenland and Iceland one day."],"259":["NONE of the fields in Greenland are suitable for soccer - NOT ALL of them are covered in grass. It's a shame, but at least they have other sports they can focus on instead!"],"260":["That's true! It's super fascinating how the names can be misleading. I guess Greenland would not be the most suitable place for farming with all that ice, right?"],"261":["That's interesting. I've never read any electronic literature."],"262":["That sounds fascinating. I would like to learn more about electronic literature."],"263":["That's true. However, not all electronic literature is easily accessible to everyone, making it a bit exclusive in some ways."],"264":["No, I'm not sure. Is New York your favorite city in the world?"],"265":["No, I have no idea why the NY area code is 212. Would you like me to look it up for you?"],"266":["I have no idea. Maybe it's because 212 is the best area code in the US!"],"267":["It was definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen."],"268":["I can see it being funny in a way, but I still think it could have been better."],"269":[" I mean, the comedy in that movie was off the charts! It was the funniest movie I've ever seen."],"270":["By far the most common way."],"271":["Well, the Vice President would always be elected through a democratic process."],"272":["Actually, I'm not sure. Maybe it was through a voting process among party members?"],"273":["MY BEST FRIEND started using Facebook around that time too. She was one of the first in our school to have one."],"274":["It's true, the shift from MySpace to Facebook was like a cultural revolution among young people. I would say it was one of the most significant shifts in social media history, don't you think?"],"275":["Yes, it's interesting how quickly things can change in the tech industry. MySpace was once one of the most popular social media platforms, but now it's neither popular nor profitable."],"276":["If they did, it would probably help them maintain their energy levels throughout the game. Would you like to try carb loading before our next workout session?"],"277":["Definitely! It would be the best way to ensure they have enough energy to burn off during the game."],"278":["They wouldn't want to lose too much weight, right?"],"279":["Haha, me too! I would never be able to keep up with those elite athletes, that's for sure."],"280":["I would like to join a running club to improve my stamina. Like, I really wish I could run long distances without feeling like I'm going to collapse."],"281":["Haha, I wouldn't go that far. I think I have the endurance of a sloth in comparison to a turtle!"],"282":["I'm sure that neither the players nor the spectators enjoyed such a one-sided match. It must have been quite a disappointment for everyone involved."],"283":["I agree, it must have been a truly embarrassing defeat. It was definitely the most one-sided game in history."],"284":["That's true, scoring 222-0 against a team that inexperienced would be a hollow victory. And I think it's safe to say that it's by far the most one-sided game in football history. "],"285":["Oh wow, I must have missed that episode! I didn't know Mr. Rogers could breakdance!"],"286":["I've seen that episode, and believe me, it was the coolest thing ever!"],"287":["I can't believe that! Mr. Rogers was such a calm and gentle man, it seems impossible that he could breakdance."],"288":[" No, I haven't heard it but I would like to listen to it sometime."],"289":["No, I haven't heard it. But I heard it's not the best seller of the century."],"290":["Oh wow, really? I haven't heard it either. What kind of music is it?"],"291":["I can understand that. Kids can be quite persuasive! But I have never been a fan of those movies myself."],"292":["None of them were disappointed with it, were they?"],"293":["I didn't think it was that special."],"294":["Bill Evans is definitely one of the best pianists in jazz history. His work with Miles Davis is legendary. Tommy Flannigan is also a fantastic pianist. You have great taste in music!"],"295":["If you don't mind me asking, what do you find so captivating about Bill Evans compared to other pianists?"],"296":["Bill Evans sounds like your best friend, huh? Like, you can never get enough of his music!"],"297":["Wow, that's impressive! He must be one of the strongest softball players out there."],"298":["Wow, that's really impressive. I wonder if any other player could beat that record."],"299":["Wow, that's impressive! I don't think I can hit a softball that far."],"300":[" Yes, if it didn't, it wouldn't have been as impactful as it was."],"301":["Wouldn't it be interesting if we could see the same story from another viewpoint? It would give us a much broader understanding of the events."],"302":["Would you like to watch it together sometime? Like, we could discuss the different perspectives in the film. I think it's really interesting."],"303":["He was by far the funniest member of the cast."],"304":["Yeah, my best friend doesn't find it strange either."],"305":["Oh, that's strange. I would have expected him to be one of the main actors in the movie."],"306":["I doubt that will happen anytime soon, unfortunately. They have very strict internet regulations there."],"307":["That would be amazing if they could, but unfortunately, internet access is heavily restricted there."],"308":["That would definitely be a game-changer for them, but I'm sure their government would never allow it."],"309":["The new iPhone just came out and I was wondering if you would like to check it out with me."],"310":["I specifically meant the new iPhone 13. Everyone is saying it is the best phone on the market now."],"311":["Would you believe the latest iPhone is the most innovative piece of technology on the market right now?"],"312":["That's insane, by far the most expensive high school game tickets I've ever heard of."],"313":["That's crazy! It would have been cool to see him play in high school."],"314":[" I can't believe that! It just shows you how talented he was even at a young age."],"315":["Interesting! I'm sure shooting granny style brought back some memories for you. Do you think you could still make shots that way?"],"316":["Oh really? The Golden State Warriors are actually the most successful team in recent years, but they are also the most controversial in terms of playing style."],"317":["Yes, not all players realize the effectiveness of the granny style. It's not only the Golden State Warriors who have players using that style, but many others too. It's definitely worth considering trying out different shooting techniques."],"318":["He's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, don't you think?"],"319":["Yeah, he's definitely one of the finest actors of his generation. I would always watch movies he starred in."],"320":["Oh, I wouldn't say he's the most famous actor in Hollywood, but he's definitely up there."],"321":["I do not think they thought it through when they named the company."],"322":["If you're looking for more information, I heard that the early Superman comics are some of the most iconic in comic book history. They set the standard for superhero stories."],"323":["I would never think of it that way! Detective comic comics is definitely not a common naming convention."],"324":[" The movie was released in 2010."],"325":["It was neither released in 2018 nor 2019."],"326":["The movie was neither released in the 1900s nor in the 2010s. It was actually released in the 1980s."],"327":["Same here, not only does it save time but also it provides a variety of perspectives in one place."],"328":["That's great, it saves time and effort, would you say it's the most convenient way to stay updated with news and gaming?"],"329":["That's smart, having all that information in one place saves a lot of time. I think it's the most convenient way to stay updated on various topics. What would you do without it?"],"330":["I thought the tension between them was palpable. Their history and connection added a layer of depth to the conflict, making it even more intense to watch."],"331":["I would always prefer to see them fighting alongside each other, facing common enemies, rather than against each other. Don't you think it's more satisfying when they work as a strong team united against a greater threat?"],"332":["Yeah, I agree. That fight was definitely not a typical argument between friends. It was by far the most intense fight scene in the movie."],"333":["No, they are not planning a sequel."],"334":["I'm not sure if they would make a sequel, but I would love to see one if they did."],"335":["They are never going to make a sequel."],"336":["I've actually never watched South Park. I've heard it can be pretty controversial."],"337":["Wow, that's impressive! I didn't know that. But I have to say, my best friend Lisa is a big fan of The Simpsons."],"338":["Wow, that's impressive! The Simpsons is definitely one of the longest-running animated shows out there. I wonder if any other show can top that record."],"339":["Well, he doesn't really believe that. He was just joking around in an interview."],"340":[" None of his ideas are supported by scientific evidence. Just because he has gorgeous eyes doesn't mean he's always right."],"341":["I can't believe that. I would never have thought he would say something like that."],"342":["It's actually quite amazing how far technology has come since then. I can't imagine a world without Amazon now, it's become such a big part of our daily lives."],"343":["No, I don't think that was a big book considering the prices back then. But you're right, the world has definitely gotten smaller with technology making it easier to connect with people all over the globe. I wonder what the future holds for the next 50 years."],"344":["Yes, it's incredible how much the world has changed from those early days of Amazon. I mean, with technology advancing at such a rapid pace, ordering a book online has become as easy as a simple click. I can't imagine a time where you couldn't just order something online and have it delivered right to your doorstep."],"345":["That's a really interesting point you brought up. It's like a domino effect, right? Like if one thing goes wrong, it affects everything else. I imagine if we could figure out what element or resource the planet lost that is causing the Helium to deplete, it would be easier to find a solution."],"346":["Well, if that were the case, we could be facing a much larger problem than we initially thought. If elements are interdependent like that, then losing one could have a ripple effect on others. That could mean that we need to take a closer look at how we are using and depleting our resources."],"347":["I don't think it's just one thing causing the depletion of Helium. It's likely a combination of various factors like increased demand, lack of sustainable production methods, and perhaps even natural helium leaks contributing to the decrease. So, don't you think it's a really complex issue that needs to be addressed urgently?"],"348":["I know, right?! It's amazing how far technology has come since then. The improvements over the years have been mind-blowing."],"349":["I didn't have the faintest idea they were still producing them in 2003. I remember playing on it for hours as a kid, but now it seems so outdated. Time flies!"],"350":["Well, not all gaming systems can stand the test of time like Nintendo did. It's impressive that it was still being produced until 2003."],"351":["yea, but I don't think I can imagine watching it again."],"352":["True, but it would be nice to see a war film that doesn't focus solely on the darkness and tragedy."],"353":["If only they had made it more light-hearted, maybe it would have been more appealing."],"354":["That's interesting! I didn't know that. Apple computers are one of the most expensive brands out there."],"355":["Wow, really? That sounds like a weird rule, but I suppose they had their reasons for implementing it. I can't imagine having to deal with that kind of situation!"],"356":["I didn't know that! That seems like a strange rule. I would never have thought of such a specific warranty violation."],"357":["I don't think they had a pink locker room. Would you like to look it up to see if they had any record of that?"],"358":["If they did have a pink locker room, it would have been a unique touch. Maybe it would be a comfort to the players after such a tough loss. Or maybe it would have just made them feel even more defeated, who knows."],"359":["I don't think Cumberland would have ever wanted to remember that game even if they had the best team spirit in the world."],"360":["MY BEST FRIEND loves cars so much that he can talk about them for hours on end without getting bored. It's quite impressive!"],"361":["That's true. Cars have definitely become one of the most essential aspects of modern life. The convenience they provide is unmatched, but the environmental impact is also undeniable."],"362":["I totally agree. Cars have a huge impact on our daily lives and it's fascinating how they shape our society."],"363":["Wow, he sounds like an amazing person! He must have been a real role model in his community."],"364":["Wow, Tim Duncan sounds like a really amazing person, not only in terms of his basketball skills but also in his charitable work and dedication to his education. My best friend could really learn a thing or two from him."],"365":["Wow, I had no idea he was so charitable. Not only did he excel in basketball, but he also made a significant impact outside of the court. Would you say he was the most generous athlete you've ever met?"],"366":["I don't think so."],"367":["I don't think he is the most talented or popular rapper out there."],"368":["He's not a particularly talented rapper, but he is quite popular. Don't you think there are better artists out there?"],"369":["No, that's not true. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was known for his skyhook shot, not for dunks."],"370":["I can't believe Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the best at dunking! It must have been frustrating for other players at the time."],"371":["I never knew that. My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he always talks about how impressive Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was. Would you like to join us for the next game?"],"372":["Yeah, both songs were quite the phenomenon in their own right. Gangnam style became the most viewed video on YouTube, while \"Baby\" holds the record for the most dislikes on the platform. It's amazing how viral content can make such an impact."],"373":["I wouldn't say Gangnam Style broke YouTube, but it definitely had a huge impact. Baby, on the other hand, is a different story."],"374":["Ha, I guess we both have the same taste in music!  Neither of us is a fan of those songs."],"375":["Actually, I've never been told I look like Steve Martin. And I don't think Bill Nye is a copy of anyone. He has his own unique style."],"376":["Yeah, it was a bit disappointing. I would have liked to win the contest."],"377":["Yeah, it was a bit disappointing to lose to someone who wasn't even a comedian. I wish it had been a fairer contest."],"378":["Yes, I actually just watched \"Parasite\" last night and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen!"],"379":["Not really, but I watched a fantastic documentary on conservation efforts in the Amazon rainforest."],"380":["Yes, I have. I watched a really interesting one last night. It was the best movie I have seen in a long time. What about you? Have you seen anything good recently?"],"381":["That's interesting, I didn't know that!  It does seem a bit unfair to the rest of the country, but I guess it's just one of those historical quirks."],"382":["Really?! I had no idea! That's such an interesting fact. I guess New York is not a stranger to being the center of attention in many aspects."],"383":["I did not know that!  New York always seems to get the most attention in one way or another."],"384":["MY BEST FRIEND has the same blood type as me, isn't that amazing? I never knew dogs had so many different blood types!"],"385":["Yeah, dogs are amazing creatures. They are so loyal and can do so many things. I think they would make great therapy animals for people in need."],"386":["I didn't know that! Dogs truly are amazing creatures. I think they would make great therapy animals for hospitals."],"387":["La La Land is about a jazz musician and an actress who fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. Would you like to watch it like sometime?"],"388":["They are both great movies; La La Land is a musical set in Los Angeles, and Zootopia is an animated film with talking animals. Have you seen any musicals like La La Land before?"],"389":["It's about a world where predators and prey live together in harmony, but not all animals are happy with this arrangement. It's a great movie, you would love it!"],"390":["It's okay, we can just watch the chat window together. It's the best way to spend time with my best friend."],"391":["Maybe we are both experiencing technical difficulties. None of the other pages seem to be loading properly either."],"392":["Isn't it just the best Christmas movie of all time?"],"393":["I used to have a dog when I was a child. I would take him for walks every day after school. But now I live in an apartment building, so I don't have a pet at the moment. But I would love to have a dog again in the future."],"394":["I don't particularly like dogs or horses, but I think it's great that Google allows dogs in the office. If I were you, I would definitely apply for a job there."],"395":["I'm more of a cat person. I find their independence and mysterious nature fascinating. And yes, Google definitely seems like a great place to work, not only because of their dog-friendly policies but also because of their innovative work culture."],"396":["I guess, but I don't think I can see it as a comedy."],"397":["If you aren't a fan of the comedy genre, you might not see it that way."],"398":["Yeah, my best friend likes it too. It's definitely NOT a comedy, DON'T YOU think?"],"399":["Haha, that's a pretty smart strategy! You're like the craftiest football player I know. I'm sure that would be the best feeling to finally get that fumble out of the way and just enjoy the game without that pressure."],"400":["That's a bold strategy, but I like the way you think. It would be a relief to finally get that weight off your shoulders. Good thinking!"],"401":["That's actually a pretty clever strategy. I mean, not only would you secure the win, but you also wouldn't have to stress about keeping the perfect record anymore. It's a win-win situation, really."],"402":["No, I haven't been to the NBA head office in NY. But I've always wanted to visit. Have you been there before?"],"403":["No, I haven't been to the NBA head office in NY, but I've heard it's the most state-of-the-art facility in the league."],"404":["No, not all Knicks fans have been to the NBA head office. But I would like to visit it someday. I've heard it's quite the experience."],"405":["I heard that Kim Peek, an American savant, is considered one of the fastest speed readers in history."],"406":["I'm not quite sure, but I believe Kim Peek, also known as the real-life Rain Man, holds that record."],"407":["I'm not sure, but I would guess it's someone with a lot of practice and dedication."],"408":["If John Lasseter hadn't directed it, I wonder if the movie would have been as successful."],"409":["Wow, I never expected that! Steve Jobs was neither a director nor a traditional film producer!"],"410":["Wow, that's impressive! Steve Jobs was not only a tech genius, but also had a keen eye for storytelling in film."],"411":["Don't you think it's irresponsible to spread such conspiracy theories? Saying that kind of thing can really harm people."],"412":["I agree. AIDS is not as deadly as some other diseases. In fact, some diseases can be much more harmful and contagious."],"413":["Actually, I think Kanye may have been trying to make a point about his identity rather than the origins of the disease. The flu is definitely a much more widespread and deadly illness compared to AIDS."],"414":["Yeah, $10 million is definitely hard to turn down! But it was impressive that Tim Duncan decided to stay in college for another year. It would be nice to have that kind of dedication to education and sports."],"415":["Tim Duncan is one of the smartest players in NBA history. He made the best decision for his future by staying in college. It's rare to find someone who prioritizes education over money in the world of professional sports."],"416":["Yeah, Tim Duncan is a true professional! I wish I had half of his dedication to my work. I'd be the happiest person alive."],"417":["That's cool, but I haven't really gotten into Greek dramas. I prefer more contemporary stories with action and suspense."],"418":["That sounds amazing! I wish they had more events like that in our city."],"419":["I'm not into Greek drama, neither tragedies nor comedies. I never found them interesting, to be honest."],"420":["I WOULD CUSTOMIZE MY PROFILE AND ADD MUSIC PLAYLISTS TO IT."],"421":["That's understandable. Social media can be overwhelming and time-consuming. It's good to take a break from it sometimes."],"422":["That's understandable. Social media can become quite overwhelming. Have you found a better balance now?"],"423":["I think Teddy Roosevelt was quite daring to create his own party in that era.  He really wanted to address certain issues aggressively."],"424":["I think that was quite a bold move. He was definitely a strong leader in the progressive movement. He showed a lot of determination and courage in creating his own party at that time."],"425":["I think it's definitely one of the boldest moves in American political history."],"426":["Wow, that's the simplest explanation ever! It's amazing how even the tiniest details can have such a significant impact on our daily lives. The intricacies of technology never cease to amaze me."],"427":["That makes sense. I wouldn't have thought of that. It's fascinating how the simplest things can have the most interesting reasons behind them."],"428":["I can't even imagine having to dial a phone number on a rotary phone every time I wanted to make a call. It must have been a lot more time-consuming than just tapping a few buttons on a screen."],"429":["Oh, absolutely! It's definitely one of the most unique and effective shooting techniques out there."],"430":["Yes, it's definitely one of the most unique shooting styles out there! Who would have thought it would be so effective in professional basketball?"],"431":["Well, it is definitely not the most conventional shooting style, but Rick Barry made it work!"],"432":["My best friend definitely prefers voting for a vice president too! It makes the election process more interesting."],"433":["I think that's probably the most democratic way possible."],"434":["That's interesting. I don't think the system should change. It's more democratic."],"435":["Oh, I didn't know that! Jorja Smith is truly one of the most talented singers in the music industry right now. Her voice is absolutely captivating."],"436":["Oh, I had no idea, I thought the tickets were more expensive. Jorja Smith is definitely one of the best artists I've seen by far."],"437":["If I had known that earlier, I would have definitely bought tickets to see Jorja Smith perform. Would you like to come with me?"],"438":["Yes, surprisingly enough, there was only one governor who vehemently opposed the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II."],"439":["Yes, Governor Ralph Carr of Colorado was the only one who did not support the internment camps. It's the faintest possibility that other governors would have taken a stand like he did."],"440":["Yes, only a few politicians had the courage to stand up against such a controversial decision. I think Governor Ralph Carr was one of the bravest. He truly cared for the rights and well-being of all Americans."],"441":["Oh wow, that's the longest movie I've seen in a while!"],"442":["Oh wow, that's by far the longest movie we've watched this year."],"443":["Would you like to watch a movie that long or would you prefer something shorter?"],"444":["Ice hockey is definitely the most popular among the three. The speed and physicality of the game make it really exciting to watch."],"445":["I think if you practiced enough, you would eventually get the hang of it!"],"446":["Don't you think skating skills would be essential for playing ice hockey effectively?"],"447":["I bet you were surprised by the revelation."],"448":["I can't believe it! French movies are the best in terms of romance."],"449":["Really? I thought it was not a typical Hollywood film."],"450":["None of my friends voted in the last election."],"451":["No, I didn't vote in the last election."],"452":["None of my family members are eligible to vote yet."],"453":["Yes, JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents in American history, with a net worth of over $1 billion in today's money."],"454":["He's not just one of the wealthiest presidents, he's the richest one in history."],"455":["Well, it would have been interesting to see how the country would have been different if those five presidents who lost the popular vote had actually won."],"456":["That sounds really challenging. I've never been one to enjoy games that make it too difficult to progress. I prefer something more casual and relaxing."],"457":["I didn't realize it would be so challenging to catch legendary Pokemon in the tournaments. It must be really exciting to compete with other players for them."],"458":["That sounds fascinating! I've always been amazed by the incredible graphics and intricate gameplay. I wouldn't have thought Pokemon Go would become this popular globally. I think it's fantastic to see how it has evolved over the years."],"459":["I can understand where you're coming from. I personally find the humor in Kung Fu Hustle to be a bit over the top, but I can see why others would enjoy it."],"460":["Would you like to watch a comedy film together sometime?"],"461":["I used to watch comedy films all the time when I was younger. I would often go to the cinema with my friends and we would laugh so hard at the silly jokes."],"462":["That's crazy! Black Panther must be the richest superhero by far. I would definitely recommend watching the movie, it's really good."],"463":["Yeah, that's true. Black Panther is definitely the richest superhero in the Marvel universe."],"464":["Yeah, Black Panther is really popular right now. I think he's definitely one of the richest superheroes ever. Would you like to watch it sometime?"],"465":["Yeah, I do. I would like to attend an NBA game someday, that would be so cool!"],"466":["Yes, I do. He's not a player anymore but he was one of the best shooters in the history of the NBA."],"467":["Yes, I do know who Reggie Miller is. He was by far one of the best shooters in NBA history."],"468":["Yes, Tupac is one of the best known rap artists of all time. His music has definitely stood the test of time."],"469":["Yes, I have heard of Tupac. He is definitely a legend in the rap music world. Would you say his music has influenced other artists in the industry?"],"470":["Yes, I have heard of Tupac. He is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. His music is still popular today, even though he passed away many years ago. If you like rap music, you should definitely check out some of his songs."],"471":["Actually, he never sold the character rights to Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, or Darth Vader to Disney."],"472":["No, I don't. But I bet it was a substantial amount. Lucasfilm was sold to Disney for $4.05 billion in 2012."],"473":["No way! He sold Lucasfilm, including all rights to Star Wars and Indiana Jones, to Disney in 2012 for a whopping $4.05 billion. It was the most incredible deal in movie history!"],"474":["Wow, that's crazy! If I were him, I would change my name immediately."],"475":["Really? I wouldn't have even guessed that the fainted possibility could be true. But with all the confusion, it must have been quite the headache for both Justin Biebers!"],"476":["That's crazy! So, do you think Justin Bieber would be banned from Facebook if he wasn't famous?"],"477":["I'm not the biggest fan of Rocky, but I'll give it a shot since you seem to think so highly of it."],"478":["I would like to watch it, Rocky is my favorite movie of all time."],"479":["I'm not really a fan of Rocky, so I probably wouldn't enjoy it too much."],"480":["By far the most impressive peak in the world! I bet the views are incredible from up there."],"481":["I doubt it. It's probably neither practical nor feasible to set up internet connectivity at such high altitudes."],"482":["I would like to visit Mt Everest one day. It seems like a really cool experience."],"483":["That's ridiculous! I would never unfriend people just for a free burger."],"484":["That's hilarious! I can't believe they came up with that idea."],"485":["That's hilarious! I heard about that promotion. I'm surprised that Burger King would come up with such a clever marketing strategy."],"486":["Yeah, she would always ignore everyone at the neighborhood parties."],"487":["I don't think she is the rudest character in the book."],"488":["Really? I found her to be the nicest character in the book.\nB: Well, I guess I can see your point, but by far the least likable to me was the antagonist.\nA: That's true, but I would argue that not all characters were completely one-dimensional.\nB: Yes, you're right. Not only were they well-developed, but also they had some surprising depth."],"489":["I would love to paint! I find it very relaxing and fulfilling."],"490":["No, I don't like to paint. I find it messy and time-consuming."],"491":["Not in the slightest. I would have never been good at it."],"492":["Of course! He's my favorite basketball player of all time."],"493":["Yeah, he was a legendary basketball player who dominated the court with his skyhook shot. Don't you think he was one of the best of all time?"],"494":["Yes, he is considered one of the best basketball players of all time."],"495":["I'm not exactly sure. I normally don't keep up with those kinds of things. I think a lot of celebrities from different movies must have won. It would be interesting to know some details about the winners."],"496":["I think they would have announced the winners already. It would be interesting to see who got the best picture award."],"497":["I'm not sure, but I heard that \"Parasite\" won Best Picture. I think it would be really nice to see a foreign film win."],"498":["None of the SpiderMan sequels have captured the magic of the original with Tobey Maguire."],"499":["I wish Gwyneth Paltrow would have appeared in more Marvel movies."],"500":["True, but none of the SpiderMan movies can compare to the special effects in Iron Man."],"501":["That's mind-blowing! I guess Qatar must be putting a lot of effort into building infrastructure for the event."],"502":["That's unbelievable! Qatar must be by far the most ambitious host country in FIFA history!"],"503":["No way! That's the most absurd thing I have ever heard. How can they host a tournament in a city that doesn't exist?"],"504":["Sorry, Jason Momoa shirtless is by far the best part of the movie."],"505":["Sure, I can type a little faster if you'd like."],"506":["Sorry, I can never type fast enough!"],"507":["I disagree, I believe the humor actually enhanced the overall viewing experience and made the characters more relatable."],"508":["I don't see how the humor took away from the seriousness. In fact, I think it added a layer of complexity to the story."],"509":["NO, I did not find Tom Hanks' character enjoyable at all. He was neither engaging nor interesting compared to other characters in the movie."],"510":["True, it must be tough for those Olympians who don't win to continue pursuing their dreams without the same financial rewards."],"511":["That is true, professional athletes can make money whether they win or lose.  It would be difficult to pursue a career in a sport where there is no financial security."],"512":["Don't you think it's hard to stay motivated when you're not achieving your goals?"],"513":["If he hadn't been working for Gru, he would have made a great scientist at another company."],"514":["I wouldn't say he was the coolest character, but he definitely had an important role in the movie."],"515":["Absolutely! I would say he was the most reliable assistant Gru had, wouldn't you agree?"],"516":["Oops, sorry for the typo. David Fincher is known for his work in movies like Fight Club and Gone Girl."],"517":["Oh, I'm sorry, I wouldn't say he's my favorite director."],"518":["Sorry, but not all of David Fincher's movies are my favorite."],"519":["Well, baseball games don't have time for that level of deliberation, do they?"],"520":["That's because an umpire must make split-second decisions on the field, which makes it one of the most challenging jobs in sports."],"521":["If a baseball or softball umpire hesitates for even a moment, they might lose the respect of players, coaches, and fans. The game demands swift and decisive calls."],"522":["Yes, their influence is definitely unparalleled. I would have been so lost without Google in those five minutes. It's amazing how one company can have such a huge impact on the internet."],"523":["Google is definitely one of the most influential companies in the world. The impact they have on the internet is unmatched. Without Google, the internet would be a very different place."],"524":["Wow, that's incredible! Google is by far the most influential company on the internet. Can you imagine how chaotic it would be if it went down for longer periods of time?"],"525":["He's actually focused on more advanced techniques used by top sales professionals. He\u2019s one of the best in his field."],"526":["No, not just penny stocks. He covers a wide range of sales strategies, from cold calling to social media marketing. He's my best teacher yet."],"527":["Well, he is the most experienced sales professional in the industry, so I'm sure he covers a wide range of techniques."],"528":["Oh, so it's not actually about a zoo, but about a world with talking mammals instead?"],"529":["Wow, that sounds interesting! I would not only watch it for the comedy but also for the creative concept."],"530":["That sounds really interesting! I would definitely recommend it, it's a super fun movie by far!"],"531":["I know, it's such a shame that such a innovative company is facing some challenges."],"532":["It would be really unfortunate if a lot of employees lost their jobs, especially after all the hard work they've put into the company."],"533":["I hope the company can find a way to avoid any layoffs, it would be a shame to see so many people lose their jobs."],"534":["Wow, I would often watch football games with my family when I was younger."],"535":["That's not fair at all. It seems like the cheerleaders have to follow stricter rules than the players themselves."],"536":["That is just ridiculous. It seems like there are some truly outdated and nonsensical rules in the world of sports. I cannot believe the faintest rationale behind such discrimination."],"537":["It's probably the smelliest costume in the history of costumes."],"538":["I wouldn't imagine it smells very good, but they must have a way to keep it clean."],"539":["Oh, I'm sure it's not a very pleasant smell, don't you think? But my best friend would still wear it proudly, she loves pandas."],"540":["It's truly amazing how they were able to create such a successful platform! The influence of Facebook in the world is undeniable. They were ahead of their time in terms of social networking. Mark Zuckerberg and his team truly are visionaries of the digital age."],"541":["I'm not sure how they convinced the other schools to join in on the platform. But I'm pretty certain that it was a combination of good marketing and the right timing. People just couldn't resist the temptation to connect with others online, no matter the consequences or ethical concerns. It's crazy to think about how much power and influence social media platforms like Facebook have nowadays."],"542":["I wouldn't be surprised if they offered special incentives to those other schools. Can you imagine being a part of the social media platform that has billions of users today? It's insane to think about!"],"543":["If you haven't seen Forrest Gump, you should definitely watch it. It's a classic and I'm sure you would enjoy it."],"544":["I have never watched any of his movies, but I've heard that \"Forrest Gump\" is one of the best."],"545":["I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with you. I don't think Tom Hanks is the best actor in Hollywood."],"546":["None, I have not read Andersen's original."],"547":["No, I haven't. But I've heard it's by far the best version of the story."],"548":["No, I haven't read it, but I hear it's not only different in some aspects, but far darker than the movie adaptation."],"549":["If you could choose to watch it now, would you go for the director's cut version?"],"550":["Not only the original film, but also the director's cut of The Exorcist is by far the most terrifying movie I have ever seen."],"551":["If I had known that, I definitely wouldn't have watched it. The original version was scary enough for me!"],"552":["Wow, I didn't know that! I can't imagine ET being a horror movie. That would have been really scary."],"553":["Yes, I did know that. ET as a horror movie would have definitely been a completely different movie experience. I wonder how it would have turned out."],"554":["I did not know that! That would have been a completely different movie if it had been a horror film. It's a good thing they changed the direction of ET. That movie is a classic that I never get tired of watching."],"555":["If would you like to watch a movie tonight?"],"556":["Great! I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if it ends up being a dud like the last one we watched."],"557":["I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever heard of that movie. Is it one of the worst films you've ever seen?"],"558":["I've never really considered having an elephant as a pet. They're just too big and require so much space."],"559":["That's true. Elephants are one of the most intelligent animals out there. They have an incredible memory and are known for their emotional intelligence."],"560":["That's true. Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and their intelligence is off the charts. I wouldn't want to mess with an angry elephant."],"561":["MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE."],"562":["He played the role so convincingly that I would have never guessed he wasn't actually a professional thief himself."],"563":["He would definitely be the best actor by far in \"Inception\"!"],"564":["Dogs have incredible sensory perception - even the faintest sound or smell can alert them to potential dangers. It's truly fascinating how they have evolved alongside humans throughout history."],"565":["Yeah, dogs can actually see some colors, just not as many as humans can. It's interesting how myths about animals like that can spread so easily."],"566":["Yeah, dogs can see some colors, just not all like humans can. But cats, on the other hand, are actually colorblind. None can see as many colors as we can."],"567":["Wow, none of my cats have ever chewed on any of my shoes."],"568":["Yeah, I wouldn't want any more of my shoes getting destroyed."],"569":["It's unbelievable how dogs can be the worst shoe destroyers!"],"570":["Would you recommend it to others?"],"571":["Did you watch it more than once, or would you only watch it once?"],"572":["Wouldn't you say that it was the most unexpected plot twist by far?"],"573":["Haha, I really doubt that, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did something like that."],"574":["I really doubt that! I don't think Trump has any musical talent at all."],"575":["I highly doubt that. Trump doesn't strike me as a music lover, let alone a talented musician."],"576":["If Maleficent did not like Princess Aurora, why would she put her under a spell?"],"577":["It sounds like Maleficent was the most misunderstood character in the story, wouldn't you agree?"],"578":["Wow, that sounds like a dark twist on the classic fairy tale. I don't think I'd like to be in Princess Aurora's shoes in that situation."],"579":["Would he often talk about his time teaching her in class?"],"580":["Wow, that's amazing! He must have been one of the best drama teachers around. I wonder if he knew she would become a famous actress one day."],"581":["Wow, that's really interesting. I would never have guessed that he was such a talented teacher!"],"582":["That sounds interesting. If we had more time, we could also visit the White House and the Lincoln Memorial. What do you think?"],"583":["That sounds amazing! The Marine Corps museum is one of the best military museums in the world. It would be so interesting to learn more about their history and traditions."],"584":["For sure! I heard it's one of the best military museums in the country. It's not only massive in size but also incredibly informative."],"585":["I don't think so"],"586":["I agree, Zootopia is one of the best animated films of recent years."],"587":["Would you say it's the best animated film of the year?"],"588":["I don't think that would work nowadays. Can you imagine the chaos if that rule was still in place?"],"589":["I think that rule was probably one of the most interesting and unique rules in the history of presidential elections! It's definitely a rule that stands out from the rest. What do you think about it?"],"590":["That rule sounds like a very interesting one. However, I think it might not be the best idea in practice, as it could lead to conflicts and disagreements. What do you think?"],"591":["I don't think I would want to be in their place!"],"592":[" Yeah, I would totally like to see a movie about evolving trees!"],"593":["Not really, the movie \"Jaws\" would never mention such a fact."],"594":["Yeah, it was actually Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph who co-founded Netflix back in 1997. They had one of the most innovative ideas in the world of entertainment."],"595":["I'm not exactly sure, but I believe he came up with the idea after facing late fees for renting movies. Wouldn't it be frustrating to keep paying those fees?"],"596":["Yes, it was actually Reed Hastings who co-founded Netflix in 1997. But actually, did you know that he originally came up with the idea after being charged a late fee for a movie rental?"],"597":["That is absolutely fascinating! The level of strategy and skill needed to intentionally avoid scoring in such a high-stakes game is mind-boggling. It really shows the cleverness of the players and coaches involved in the sport."],"598":["I didn't know that! It's amazing how such memorable moments can happen in the biggest sporting event of the year. It must have been one of the most bizarre plays in Superbowl history."],"599":["Really? I did not know that! That seems like a very strange strategy in such an important game. I don't you think that would have been pretty controversial among fans and experts?"],"600":["I would always read animal facts as a kid, they were so fascinating. Actually, in the 1800s, the common belief was that the sound of hiccups was the devil trying to steal your soul!"],"601":["Interesting! I had no idea about that fact. Not all animals hiccup, but it's fascinating to think about the evolution of such a phenomenon."],"602":["It's hard to say for sure, but I think hiccups are something we all experience.  Even the faintest sound can wake me up at night."],"603":["I didn't have a Nintendo 64, but I would play the NES at my friend's house all the time. It was so much fun."],"604":["None of my friends had a Nintendo console, so I missed out on that experience."],"605":["I didn't have a Nintendo 64, don't you think the NES was the best console of all time?"],"606":["Yes, it has one of the best actors in Hollywood who recently won an Oscar for his performance."],"607":["Yes, there is one famous actor who plays the lead role."],"608":["There isn't even the slightest well-known actor in it, but the acting is absolutely superb."],"609":["That's interesting! I wonder how the cars ended up being left in the bars."],"610":["Oh, would you believe it? That sounds like a dream come true!"],"611":["Wow, that's fascinating! If you don't mind me asking, did he keep the cars or sell them?"],"612":["MY BEST FRIEND is coming to visit me today."],"613":["Wouldn't you agree that it's a beautiful day outside?"],"614":["Would you like to grab a coffee later? I know this great cafe nearby with the finest pastries."],"615":["It's interesting how athletes and celebrities can impact politics like that. I guess in a way, their influence transcends just their field of work. It makes you wonder how endorsements would affect elections in today's world, don't you think?"],"616":["Interesting, so it seems like not only were senators elected differently back then, but even endorsements were based on different criteria. It's a reminder that not all decisions are made purely on principles, but also on other factors like business or personal relationships."],"617":["That's definitely a smart move on his part. Michael Jordan is by far the greatest basketball player of all time, but politics can be tricky. Don't you think it's interesting how athletes can have such a big influence on public opinion?"],"618":["Really? I didn't know that! So dogs can actually see colors?"],"619":["No, I didn't know that! I always thought dogs could only see in black and white."],"620":["No, I had no idea! That's fascinating! Dogs are truly incredible animals with a lot of amazing abilities in their senses."],"621":["You should definitely watch it then. I'm sure you'll enjoy it thoroughly."],"622":["You should definitely watch it too, I think you'll really enjoy it."],"623":["You should definitely watch it! My best friend said it was the best movie she has ever seen."],"624":["I didn't know WWII soldiers listened to the radio. Did they really have access to music during that time?"],"625":["I don't think I would enjoy listening to the radio all the time. I prefer using streaming services like Pandora or Spotify. But it's interesting to know that WWII soldiers listened to the radio."],"626":["That's an interesting perspective! I personally can't stand the faintest sound of the radio. It's just too distracting for me. What about you?"],"627":["Yeah, by far, he is one of the most unconventional celebrities out there. His sense of humor is so unique and he's just not afraid to be himself, I guess that's why people find him so fascinating."],"628":["Yeah, he definitely made the right choice. It would have been the worst move by far if he had taken the money and run."],"629":["Yeah, I agree. He's definitely one of the most interesting celebrities out there, with his eccentric style and unique sense of humor."],"630":["Yes, did you like the animation style?"],"631":["Yes, what did you think? Would you like to watch it again sometime?"],"632":["I thought it was the best animated film I've seen in a long time."],"633":["It's possible, but unlikely."],"634":["No, it's actually completely fictional. In fact, it's the most fantastical location in the entire film series by far."],"635":["I'm not sure, but I think it would be the most beautiful filming location if it were real."],"636":["He played for the San Antonio Spurs.  Would you believe that he played his entire career with just one team, such loyalty was rare to find in the sports industry."],"637":["He used to play for the San Antonio Spurs but he retired a few years ago. He was by far the most consistent and reliable player on that team."],"638":["He played his entire career with the San Antonio Spurs. He was not only an exceptional player on the court but also a great role model off the court as well. Don't you think he's one of the most humble and hardworking athletes out there?"],"639":["I would like to see that in person! Like, I bet it adds a unique sound to his guitar playing."],"640":["Yeah, it's pretty common actually. Brian May was one of the most innovative guitarists of his time."],"641":["Yeah, it's definitely a unique technique. Have you ever tried using coins as guitar picks like Brian May?"],"642":["Really? I had no idea they were struggling that much. I'll have to pay closer attention to their games from now on."],"643":["LeBron is definitely playing his best this season, I think he's the key to the Lakers' success."],"644":["That's too bad, I was hoping they would be at the top of the standings. Hopefully they will improve soon."],"645":["Well, it must have been quite an ordeal for the spectators, watching a game that never seemed to end!"],"646":["Don't you think that would be the absolute longest game to sit through, not a single person would have the faintest desire to stay for that duration!"],"647":["It must have been super exhausting to play and watch! I like thrilling games, but not a never-ending one like that."],"648":["The intricacies of the legal battles and personal dynamics in the film are fascinating, revealing the faintest hints of deception and betrayal amongst supposed friends."],"649":["Exactly! The development of Facebook was not just a simple success story. Don't you think Zuckerberg's journey from a college dorm room to becoming the youngest self-made billionaire is truly remarkable?"],"650":["Yeah, it's true. MY BEST FRIEND Mark really turned Facebook into something huge. He's definitely not someone who would settle for just the basics."],"651":["That's correct! It's amazing how such a simple incident led to the creation of one of the most successful streaming platforms in the world."],"652":["Yes, that's the story! It's incredible how such a small inconvenience could lead to the creation of a platform with the widest range of content available."],"653":["Yes, that's the one! It must have been quite frustrating for him. He decided to create a better way to watch movies."],"654":["That's interesting! I had no idea that there was such a regulation in place. It seems like a great way to promote Canadian artists globally."],"655":["Wow, really? I didn't know that! Imagine if they did that in other countries, it would be interesting to see how it would affect the music industry."],"656":["No, I had no idea about that. My best friend from Canada never mentioned it before."],"657":["Me too, that would be a dream come true!"],"658":["Haha, that would be the most epic act of rebellion against unread terms and conditions! I doubt the faintest trace of those agreements would remain in history."],"659":["Haha, that would be a superlative idea! But unfortunately, I highly doubt they would do that."],"660":["No, I didn't know that Steve Jobs was involved in this movie."],"661":["Yes, I did. It's interesting how his involvement helped make the movie even better. I wish I had the slightest bit of his creativity and vision."],"662":["Yeah, I heard that too. It's amazing how influential he was."],"663":["Well, why don't you try restarting your computer?"],"664":["Did that help at all?"],"665":["u could try restarting the computer, or else it's likely the keyboard is broken."],"666":["I wish I had! It would have been amazing to see that."],"667":["No, I didn't. But I heard it was one of the best sitcoms from the 90s."],"668":["Yes, I would say that was one of the funniest moments in television history. The comedy in that show was superbly written and the actors were incredibly talented."],"669":["Neither do I watch TV nor do I enjoy reruns. I prefer reading books or going for a run in my free time."],"670":["I don't watch TV often, but when I do, I prefer to binge-watch series on streaming platforms. It's more convenient."],"671":["I used to watch TV a lot, but lately, I haven't had much time. Don't you miss the simplicity of just relaxing in front of the TV?"],"672":["Would you like me to give you a brief summary of the Snow Queen story?"],"673":["If you watch the movie, you would understand the story better. Would you like me to explain it to you?"],"674":["Don't you worry, the story is based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen and is considered one of the darkest and most dramatic Disney tales. Would you like me to give you a quick summary?"],"675":["I'm glad you mentioned that. My best friend is a marine biologist and she loves studying sharks. She always talks about how misunderstood they are and how important they are to the ocean's ecosystem!"],"676":["Absolutely, sharks are incredibly fascinating creatures with a reputation for being the top predators of the ocean. It's crucial to protect them and their habitats in order to maintain the balance of marine ecosystems. I would love to see more efforts to educate people on the importance of shark conservation. Like organizing awareness campaigns or supporting marine conservation organizations."],"677":["Absolutely, sharks are fascinating creatures with a long history of evolution. They are some of the oldest living creatures on Earth, with incredible adaptations that have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments. In fact, some species of sharks have been around for millions of years, making them some of the most ancient animals on the planet."],"678":["Maybe we can all do our part to protect the forests by planting more trees and being mindful of our consumption. It's important to appreciate the beauty and balance of nature."],"679":["None of us can deny the beauty and complexity of our planet and the interactions between the Earth and the moon. It's not only fascinating but crucial for our existence."],"680":["I don't think we can ever fully understand the complexity of nature, but it's truly fascinating how everything works together. My best friend once told me that the ocean tides are influenced by the moon's gravitational pull more than the sun's."],"681":[" MY BEST FRIEND and I were in tears during those scenes."],"682":["Would you like to watch a comedy movie instead to cheer up?"],"683":["Definitely, that movie was full of some of the saddest scenes in cinematic history."],"684":["MY BEST FRIEND uses Youtube to learn how to cook new recipes. She says it's the easiest way to follow along and try new dishes at home."],"685":["If I were to start using Youtube for more practical purposes, what type of videos would you recommend I search for first?"],"686":["That's impressive! It sounds like you've really found a goldmine on Youtube with all the helpful videos. It must be one of the best ways to learn new skills and save money."],"687":["Actually, neither Nike nor Adidas offered him more at that time."],"688":["Yep, by far, Nike ended up offering him a contract worth $15 million."],"689":["Yes, Nike ended up offering him one of the best sponsorship deals in the history of sports."],"690":["None of the other comedy shows can compare to the classic humor of The Simpsons. It's a true icon in the world of television comedy."],"691":["None of the comedy shows can beat The Simpsons in terms of longevity and cultural impact."],"692":["I would not watch SNL for news, the skits are funny but not very informative."],"693":["It's called \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" and it's one of the best films I've seen recently. The part I didn't like was the ending, it felt a bit rushed."],"694":["It's called \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and it is by far the best drama movie I have ever seen. The part I don't like is when the protagonist goes through a very difficult time in prison."],"695":["The movie title is \"The Eternal Love\" and the part I don't like is the ending. It's just not a satisfying conclusion, don't you think?"],"696":["Not only was it directed by Shawn Levy, but it also has a great soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman."],"697":["Shawn Levy directs it. He's not a well-known director, but he has directed some successful comedies in the past."],"698":["Shawn Levy directed it. He's the best director for this kind of film."],"699":["Absolutely. With advancements in technology happening so rapidly, autonomous cars could become mainstream sooner than we think. It's definitely a fascinating time to be alive."],"700":["Exactly. It would be interesting to see how autonomous cars will change the way we travel."],"701":["I agree. Autonomous cars would definitely be a major game changer in transportation. People would probably never have to worry about driving in traffic again."],"702":["They do, but I have never used it. Neither my friends nor my family have, either. I guess streaming is just much more convenient now."],"703":["NONE. Not all people are into streaming, some still prefer renting DVDs through the mail for a more traditional experience."],"704":["It's not only practical but also cost-effective for Netflix, considering how many people still prefer physical copies of movies."],"705":["I do not like movies of historical or political genre."],"706":["Yes, I would like historical and political movies. But by far, my favorite genre is comedy."],"707":["No, I don't like them. My best friend loves those kinds of movies.\nB: Why don't you like them? What genre of movies do you usually watch?"],"708":["Indeed, it is intriguing that no recent presidents are among the richest. It seems like the economic status of presidents has shifted over time."],"709":["Well, MY BEST FRIEND told me that many recent presidents have been wealthy before taking office, so they may not be included in the list of richest presidents."],"710":["Yes, it's quite surprising that no recent presidents are on the list, but I guess none of them have had the slightest wealth compared to those historical figures."],"711":["That's nice. Is the new mother the best mom he's ever had?"],"712":["So he doesn't have the faintest idea about where his birth mother is now?"],"713":["Is she the best mother he's ever had?"],"714":["MY BEST FRIEND is a die-hard Miami Heat fan!"],"715":["Not all fans of James liked it when he went to the Miami Heat, but I have to admit, it was a smart move for him in order to win championships."],"716":["I didn't like when James went to the Miami Heat. He was by far the best player of his generation and he could have won more with the Cleveland Cavaliers."],"717":["Exactly, but with a fresh perspective and new twists. Have you seen it before?"],"718":["Yes, it's a fresh take on how Batman became the Dark Knight. It's really worth watching. Don't you think it would be exciting to see a new perspective on his journey?"],"719":["Yes, but not only the original story. Batman Begins delves much deeper into the character's background and motivations."],"720":["True, but not all of their original content is a hit. Some series and movies are not as successful as others."],"721":["Absolutely! Netflix is by far the most popular streaming service out there. I've never seen anything quite like it."],"722":["That is unbelievable! Netflix has become one of the most successful streaming services in the world. I can't imagine life without it now."],"723":["There is by far the most intense battle scenes I have ever seen in a war movie, but surprisingly, there are no specific mentions of any religious or ethnic groups."],"724":["No, there aren't any specific references to any particular group or individuals in the movie."],"725":["No, there are not any specific mentions of any particular groups or race in the movie. It's more about the overall experience of war and survival."],"726":["I guess anything is possible when you're desperate enough."],"727":["That's dedication. She must be one of the best mothers I've ever heard of. She would always do anything for her child's safety."],"728":["I wouldn't say that was the best decision."],"729":["My best friend said the movie was really exciting and suspenseful!"],"730":["Oh, I wouldn't have thought that he would pretend to be a substitute teacher! Was it convincing in the movie?"],"731":["If I watched it, I would have never guessed that about his character."],"732":["No, definitely not! It's pretty hard to believe that people are still using such outdated technology in this day and age."],"733":["Never have I seen such outdated technology still in use! It's like using a typewriter in the age of computers."],"734":["Like I totally get what you mean, using floppy disks is the faintest idea in this day and age!"],"735":["So you didn't really choose to watch them for yourself, did you?"],"736":["That's cool. Harry Potter is one of the most popular book series of all time."],"737":["Oh, that's interesting. If you watched Harry Potter with her, you might enjoy Fantastic Beasts as well."],"738":["That's hilarious! I think a judge delivering a ruling in the form of a rap must be the most entertaining thing ever at a court."],"739":["That's pretty cool! I've never heard of a judge doing that before."],"740":["None of the judges would have done something like that in a million years! What an unexpected twist!"],"741":["Yeah, Carter was definitely ahead of his time with those energy-saving initiatives. DON'T YOU think more politicians should prioritize sustainability and conservation efforts?"],"742":["He sounds like the epitome of a responsible leader, always putting the environment first."],"743":["Yes, his efforts in energy conservation were truly commendable. Carter's commitment to reducing energy consumption set a great example for future leaders."],"744":["They probably thought it was hilarious, especially if he danced with such grace. I would think that they would always bring up his ballet background whenever they wanted to mess with him."],"745":["I mean, being a ballet dancer in a tough rap world must have been quite challenging, but it shows his versatility and talent!"],"746":["He would never let those teasing comments affect him, he was always confident in his abilities."],"747":["I would say he was absolutely the most captivating part of the whole movie."],"748":["Would you say Chris Pine was the best actor in the film?"],"749":["He is definitely one of the best actors in action movies."],"750":["Yeah, McDonald's drive thru is definitely one of the best inventions in the fast-food industry."],"751":["If McDonald's created the drive thru, then they must have thought it would make ordering faster and easier."],"752":["No, McDonald's created the drive-thru for convenience, not just heroes."],"753":["I enjoy reading physical books more than digital ones, I believe it just enhances the whole experience. Plus, with physical books, you have the added benefit of flipping through the pages and feeling the texture of the paper, don't you think?"],"754":["My best friend is a bookworm, he reads all the time! But I prefer to listen to podcasts instead of reading. It's easier for me to multitask that way."],"755":["I enjoy reading physical books as well as e-books, but lately I have been more into audiobooks too. Have you ever listened to an audio book narrated by a famous actor?"],"756":["I think watching March Madness is one of the best excuses to get out of work or chores, as long as it doesn't become a habit."],"757":["I wouldn't know, I'm not willing to go to that extreme just to watch some games haha"],"758":["I guess they really love basketball. Some people would never miss a game, even if it means going to such lengths."],"759":["I listen to the radio all the time. The music is by far the best way to start my day!"],"760":["Not a lot, I prefer to listen to music on my phone. Don't you find radio commercials annoying sometimes?"],"761":["If I had more time in the day, I would listen to it more often."],"762":["Definitely! I can't imagine being on the losing side of a game like that. It must have been really tough for the Cumberland team."],"763":["I wouldn't want to be a Cumberland fan during that game! It sounds like it was a tough day for them."],"764":["Definitely! Being a Cumberland fan during that game must have been the most disappointing experience ever!"],"765":["Yeah, it's fascinating to think about how different we used to be. Can you imagine what life would be like if we still had all that body hair?"],"766":["Absolutely! But finding the key to immortality is not as simple as studying zebrafish genetics. Only some of the answers lie in the depths of the sea."],"767":["It's true that humans are not the hairiest creatures out there, but I believe there are some animals that are even less hairy than us."],"768":["I don't know why they can't go back. It's strange."],"769":["I would think it has to do with preserving the genetic purity of the Icelandic horse breed."],"770":["I'm not sure, but maybe it has to do with protecting the purity of the Icelandic horse breed. Like they want to maintain their unique characteristics."],"771":["Actually, I have not seen Frozen yet. But I've heard good things about it!"],"772":["Yes, I have never seen Frozen, but I've heard that it's a great film. Did you like it?"],"773":["Actually, I haven't seen Frozen yet, but I've heard it's one of the best animated movies ever made!"],"774":["Yes, I agree. The development of characters is one of the most important aspects of a film. It's essential in creating a connection between the audience and the characters on screen."],"775":["Yeah, definitely! This movie did a great job at making Gru by far the most likable animated villain I've ever seen."],"776":["Yes, absolutely. It's so important to have those character development moments in films, don't you think? It adds depth and makes the story more engaging."],"777":["Actually, I don't have a favorite type of clothes. I like to keep my wardrobe simple and practical."],"778":["I would love a nice comfy sweater for the winter, like the one I got last year that is the warmest one I own."],"779":["I don't have a favorite type of clothes, I'm not a fashion expert like you. Don't you think it's all about feeling comfortable and confident in what you wear?"],"780":["I WOULD LIKE TO WATCH THIS FILM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME?"],"781":["HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST MARVEL MOVIE YET?"],"782":["IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SUPERHERO FILMS I'VE SEEN RECENTLY, HAVE YOU WATCHED IT YET?"],"783":["No, I didn't own either a NES or a SNES. I never really got into video games, to be honest."],"784":["I did have a NES growing up, and by far, Super Mario Bros. 3 was my favorite game on the system. What about you?"],"785":["No, I don't own a nes or a snes. I'm not a big gamer, to be honest. What about you, do you still play on them?"],"786":["Really? I didn't know that. So, Facebook is not colorful for him."],"787":["I wouldn't have the faintest idea that Zuckerberg is colorblind."],"788":["That's interesting! I didn't know that about Zuckerberg. None of my friends have ever mentioned that before."],"789":["Not really, but I've heard it's incredibly complex with its extensive vocabulary and intricate grammar structures."],"790":["No, I don't speak any Latin at all. Not a single word."],"791":["No, I don't speak any Latin at all. But would you be interested in learning it together?"],"792":["That's interesting! I like the idea of supporting local artists, so it would be great to see more countries implement a similar policy. It would help showcase the talent from those countries!"],"793":["I'm glad you find those radio facts fascinating! Canadian music is amazing too though, so diverse and talented! What are some of your favorite Canadian artists? My best friend absolutely loves Drake, but my favorite Canadian musician is Celine Dion - her voice is incredible!"],"794":["I would love to go to Canada and listen to some of that music. It sounds amazing!"],"795":["Oh, you don't enjoy playing video games then?"],"796":["That's cool, have you ever tried playing video games though? You might actually like them."],"797":["That's cool, but you're missing out! It was one of the best gaming consoles of all time."],"798":["That's true! It would be interesting to see how that information could be used to improve player performance even more."],"799":["If engineers continue to innovate in sports technology, who knows what advancements we'll see in the future?"],"800":["Would you consider engineering as one of the best career choices based on this information?"],"801":["When it comes to protecting wildlife, not every state takes it as seriously as they should."],"802":["It's disappointing to hear that they won't be able to continue their work in Iowa."],"803":["That decision is totally wrong, Iowa is definitely not the most responsible state when it comes to wildlife conservation efforts."],"804":[" Yes, I have! It makes the search results tilt slightly to the side. It would be fun to see what other Easter eggs Google has hidden in their search engine."],"805":["Yes, I have. I found it amusing how the search results were slightly tilted. Google certainly knows how to keep things interesting, don't you think?"],"806":["Yes, I have! It's so cool how the search results tilt slightly to the right. Google always finds a way to surprise us."],"807":["Yeah, McCoy will probably have to step up and play at a high level if he wants to fill Smith's shoes properly."],"808":["McCoy is a decent backup, but I don't think he can fill Smith's shoes. His injury was really unfortunate."],"809":["Yeah, it's really unfortunate. Both McCoy and Smith are great players, but McCoy is by far the better choice for the team right now."],"810":["Would you recommend it?"],"811":["Would you say it was incredibly popular or just moderately successful?"],"812":["Was it the latest one with the best special effects?"],"813":["Oh, I don't think a curse has anything to do with their losing streak. I believe it's just a matter of bad luck and poor management."],"814":["I don't think they were cursed at all. It's just a superstitious belief among fans. Have you ever heard of a team with the faintest hint of timeworn curse lasting that long before?"],"815":["I would never say the cubs are cursed, but they do seem to have the faintest luck when it comes to winning the World Series."],"816":["It sounds like that was a truly unforgettable and unique moment in sports history with the marine corps carrying the Canada Flag into the stadium. Events like that really make the World Series stand out from other sporting events around the world."],"817":["I don't remember that happening, but it does sound quite interesting. I personally have never seen such a memorable moment in sports."],"818":["I agree, that was definitely one of the most embarrassing moments in the history of sports. How the marine corps could make such a mistake on such a grand stage is beyond me!"],"819":["That's great to hear! Don't you find that reading opens up new worlds and perspectives?"],"820":["Would you say reading has had a positive impact on your life in general?"],"821":["That's true, reading really opens up a whole new world of possibilities and ideas. It's definitely worth the time and effort, don't you think?"],"822":["I don't think Meryl Streep is in the top for most film appearances, but she definitely has a lot of great ones. She's so talented."],"823":["I'm not sure if Meryl Streep is on top of that list, but she has definitely had an impressive career in film. Have you checked out her performances in dramas? She would certainly be among the top actresses in that genre."],"824":["I'm not sure about Meryl Streep but there are definitely some talented actors on that list. I think it's by far the most popular website for movie information."],"825":["MY BEST FRIEND probably realized that the toxic flowers were affecting the animals more than we originally thought."],"826":["Would you like to investigate the toxic flowers further to confirm our suspicions?"],"827":["Absolutely! That would explain their abnormal behavior perfectly. It was the last thing I would have expected."],"828":["He's one of the most popular actors in Hollywood."],"829":["He is NOT a famous actor, DON'T YOU think?"],"830":["If you met him, would you tell him I'm his biggest fan?"],"831":["None of Psy's videos have reached that level of success though. Not every video can go viral like Gangnam Style did."],"832":["I wouldn't underestimate Psy's success. His catchy songs and unique dance moves definitely set him apart."],"833":["None of my videos have even come close to that level of views. Not only do I lack the talent, but also the luck to go viral like that."],"834":["Yes, I use the internet every day. It would be difficult for me to imagine life without it."],"835":["None of my friends would believe this, but I actually hardly use the internet at all. I prefer reading books or going outside."],"836":["No, I don't use the internet much, I prefer reading books. How about you?"],"837":["Yes, they have one of the richest histories in baseball with multiple World Series championships."],"838":["Absolutely, the Cubs have been around since 1876. They're one of the oldest teams in the league!"],"839":["Yes, they are like the second oldest team in MLB, aren't they?"],"840":["I hope so too, his last film was the best of the year in my opinion."],"841":["Let's hope so! The cinematography in this film was absolutely stunning."],"842":["I don't think he will."],"843":["Most likely they do, since the original cast did an excellent job with the previous films."],"844":["No, they wouldn't have said yet if all the voice actors will be returning."],"845":["I think they would always want to bring back the original voice actors for the best results."],"846":["My favorite rapper is Eminem."],"847":["My best friend would always come up with creative ways to solve problems like that."],"848":["I would never have thought a judge could be so creative in a courtroom setting."],"849":["You don't have to worry about that. See you next time!"],"850":["Thanks, you too. Stay safe!"],"851":["Would you mind continuing this conversation later? It's been really interesting talking to you."],"852":["I bet they were able to pick up some of the most valuable news with those makeshift radios."],"853":["I don't think they were able to catch much at all, definitely not the latest hits."],"854":["I doubt they were able to catch the latest news or music with those radios."],"855":["Those cardboard computers must have been challenging to use. Did you know that many people prefer laptops over desktop computers because they're more portable?"],"856":["Don't you think technology has come a long way since then?"],"857":["I agree, those cardboard computers must have been the worst. Can you imagine trying to do any kind of work on one of those?"],"858":["I know, it's hard to imagine so many people using the same service. It seems like everyone has a Netflix account nowadays."],"859":["Yes, it's crazy how popular it is. I wish there were more classic movies available, it would be great to see some old Hollywood films on there."],"860":["I know, right? Netflix has become the go-to streaming service for so many people. I would say it's the most popular platform for TV series and movies among all the others."],"861":["I didn't know that! He must have been pretty young back then."],"862":["Wow, that's really interesting! I never would have guessed that Bill Murray voiced the Human Torch. That must have been one of the most unexpected casting choices of the time!"],"863":["I didn't know that! If I had to pick one actor who could voice a superhero character, he would be my top choice."],"864":["I think it's more about privacy concerns in Schleswig-Holstein. It's one of the strictest states in Germany when it comes to data protection regulations. In fact, it's considered the best example of protecting people's online privacy in the country."],"865":["I wouldn't necessarily say that Germans have no sense of humor, perhaps they are just more cautious about privacy issues."],"866":["I do not think Germans have no sense of humor. Maybe they just prefer expressing their opinions in a different way."],"867":["That's shocking! It's unbelievable that such high percentage of players end up broke after their careers are over. It's really important for them to receive financial education and support during their time in the league."],"868":["Yeah, it's really sad to see that happen to so many players. My best friend thinks that financial education should be a mandatory part of professional sports training programs."],"869":["Wow, that's really surprising. I had no idea the percentage was that high. It's a good thing the league is trying to implement new rules to help players handle their finances better."],"870":["Would you say that this rule has helped to create a more fair and transparent political system in Guatemala?"],"871":["Absolutely, I believe that corruption should never be tolerated in any form. Good governance is essential for a functioning society."],"872":["Absolutely, not having any family ties to past presidents can definitely prevent conflicts of interest. It's a smart move to ensure fair and transparent leadership."],"873":["I totally agree! Our ability to manipulate tools and objects has really set us apart in the animal kingdom. Don't you think it's incredible how something so seemingly simple has had such a profound impact on our evolution?"],"874":["That's true, we really are the best species when it comes to using tools and our hands. I heard that even some animals, like chimpanzees, can't match our ability to make and use tools."],"875":["Yes, our ability to create and utilize tools has definitely played a significant role in our advancement as a species. Don't you find it incredible that such seemingly small skills have had such a massive impact on our evolution?"],"876":["My best friend thinks he will be the star of the movie."],"877":["I'm not so sure about that, I've never really been a fan of those movies."],"878":["I can't wait to see him in the movie, he is such a talented actor."],"879":["That's awesome! I used to play that game too. I would spend hours exploring every corner of Hyrule and battling monsters. It brings back so many memories."],"880":["That's one of the best games of all time in my opinion. The graphics may not be as advanced as today's games, but the storyline and gameplay are unbeatable."],"881":["That game is definitely one of the best of its kind. The graphics may be outdated now, but the gameplay is still unbeatable!"],"882":["It's possible, but I highly doubt it. Tom Brad seems to have the utmost respect for his wife and her accomplishments."],"883":["That's a good point. In my opinion, neither Tom nor his wife should be jealous of each other's success. They both seem to have their own strengths and achievements."],"884":["I have heard that his wife is quite successful in her career. She is obviously the breadwinner in the family."],"885":["I know, it's unbelievable! Seinfeld and Friends are two of the most iconic sitcoms of all time. Third Rock from the Sun must have had some amazing writing and acting to come out on top."],"886":["Yeah, it's hard to believe. It would have been a different story if they had won instead. They definitely deserved it more."],"887":["I agree, it's hard to believe that 3rd Rock from the Sun actually won over those iconic shows. It definitely must have been a surprising victory for them."],"888":["I think it would be convenient to have a self-driving car, especially for long road trips."],"889":["I don't think they will ever be as safe as human drivers. Do you think they are the future of transportation?"],"890":["I think Google's self-driving cars are the most groundbreaking development in automotive technology in recent years."],"891":["Maybe he just wanted to try something different.  I think if he hadn't directed Jaws, he would have pursued a career in music."],"892":["If you ask me, he probably just wanted to try something new and challenge himself. He's always looking for ways to improve and expand his talents. You never know, maybe playing the clarinet on the soundtrack was on his bucket list!"],"893":["I'm not sure why he took on the clarinet part in the soundtrack, but maybe he just wanted to show off his talents even more. He's not only a great director, he is a talented musician as well."],"894":["Wow, that's impressive! Writing a 224-word palindrome is definitely a remarkable achievement. He must be one of the best wordplay geniuses out there."],"895":["That must have been quite a challenge! I wouldn't be able to do that even if I practiced for years."],"896":["Wow, that's impressive! I can't even imagine writing a 224-word palindrome. This guy must be really talented, don't you think?"],"897":["Yes, her nurturing instincts were truly remarkable. The depth of her care and concern for Big Mike was evident from the way she welcomed him with open arms into her family."],"898":["I agree. She would not have been able to make such a strong connection with him if she had not been nurturing by nature."],"899":["I agree, it's as if she was the most caring and compassionate person in their community."],"900":["I love the Lakers! They are my favorite team and they are doing really well this season. How about you, do you have a favorite team?"],"901":["Well, I'm not really a big basketball fan, but I do like to watch the Lakers from time to time. They have the best overall record in the league right now!"],"902":["My best friend, who is a huge basketball fan, would never miss a game of his favorite team! But unfortunately, they are not doing so well this season."],"903":["Pluto will always be a planet in my heart. It's my favorite dwarf planet out there."],"904":["Yeah, poor Pluto. It's like the runt of the litter when you compare it to the other planets in our solar system. But hey, it still holds a special place in our hearts as the former ninth planet."],"905":["If Pluto were still considered a planet, would it have been your favorite?"],"906":["It was definitely one of the biggest controversies in recent college football history. The whole situation was just really disappointing. Urban Meyer is supposed to be one of the best coaches in the game, so it was shocking to see him involved in something like that."],"907":["I think it was definitely a challenging situation for Ohio State. It's hard to say if they handled it well, but I'm sure it was super stressful for everyone involved."],"908":["I think it was a messy situation. I mean, he's one of the most successful college football coaches in recent history, so it was definitely surprising. Don't you think the controversy surrounding him affected the team's performance?"],"909":["He's definitely the most reliable friend of all time."],"910":["None of the other actors in the film have that kind of chemistry."],"911":["I would really like to meet Carey Mulligan someday. She seems like a great actress."],"912":["If you had to choose one, who would it be?"],"913":["I've never read the book, so I can't say."],"914":["Those are great choices! I think the sister is by far the most interesting character."],"915":["True, that would be amazing. I've never understood why we haven't fully utilized solar power yet."],"916":["Absolutely! If only we could develop technology to make that happen, it would revolutionize the way we power our world."],"917":["That would have been the greatest thing ever! The potential for solar energy is immense."],"918":["That's great to hear! I didn't realize Lebron was already such a star in high school. I can imagine how expensive tickets must have been."],"919":["Not all high school games are that expensive. Some of them are actually quite affordable."],"920":["That sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to see a high school game like that sometime."],"921":["I actually did invest in Facebook at the IPO in 2012. It was one of the best financial decisions I've ever made."],"922":["No, I didn't. I would never invest in Facebook's IPO."],"923":["I wouldn't say I was one of the first investors. I actually bought some shares a few years after the IPO."],"924":[" Definitely, Disney movies can be quite dark despite their family-friendly facade. The impact of those scenes can be quite profound on young viewers."],"925":["You're right, not all Disney movies have a happy-go-lucky ending. Some include dark themes that can be unsettling for younger audiences."],"926":["Definitely, Disney movies often have dark undertones that can be quite unsettling, even in what are supposed to be children's films. Disney definitely knows how to mix light and dark themes seamlessly."],"927":["Isn't it more commonly used in rock and blues genres?"],"928":["No, the fender stratocaster wasn't intended for country music."],"929":["Wouldn't you agree that the electric guitar has revolutionized music in countless genres?"],"930":["Definitely, without that line I probably wouldn't understand half of what's happening on the field."],"931":["Yes, definitely! It's definitely one of the best innovations in sports broadcasting."],"932":["Yeah, exactly. If they hadn't come up with that idea, watching football would be much more confusing. It really revolutionized how we watch sports."],"933":["Finding someone with such an extensive knowledge on animated films is fascinating. Your understanding of the genre is exceptional."],"934":["That's awesome! You must be really good at analyzing characters and storylines. I bet you're like the best at recognizing hidden messages and themes in films. It would be so cool to have your expertise when watching a movie together sometime."],"935":["Well, I don't think I've ever met anyone who knows more about animated films than you do. That's impressive!"],"936":["Yes, it's actually one of the best movies I've seen this year."],"937":["Yes, the movie was actually the best movie I have ever seen."],"938":["Yeah, it's definitely the best movie I've seen in a long time."],"939":["I don't think Hugh Laurie made 700,000 an episode for House. It sounds like a lot of money!"],"940":["Ya, Hugh Laurie's salary for House is by far the highest in TV history, I can't even imagine making that much money for a single episode."],"941":["I doubt many people would complain about making that much money for a day's work, that's for sure!"],"942":["I would like to see it sometime."],"943":["Wow, that sounds like an amazing cast! I would love to see it."],"944":["Oh, I wouldn't say Quinton Aaron is the most famous actor, but he does a great job in this role."],"945":["Wow, that sounds amazing! It must be one of the best ways to experience the golden age of radio. Can you imagine all the incredible shows and talented performers you can discover on there?"],"946":["No, I didn't know that! It would be really cool to explore that, by far the most nostalgic way to experience past entertainment."],"947":["None of that surprises me. I would love to explore that website sometime. It would be interesting to hear the different types of radio shows they had back in the day."],"948":["That's very interesting. If you want, I can share some more information with you later."],"949":["Actually, my best friend is really into rock climbing. It's her favorite hobby and she's always looking for different places to climb."],"950":["I would gladly tell you more about my topic. I find it absolutely fascinating. Did you know that humans use creativity as a way of problem-solving, making them the most innovative species on Earth?"],"951":["Oh, wow, that must have been a shock for everyone. I guess they were not expecting to be caught in such a situation."],"952":["Oh wow, that must have been a shock. Was that the most audacious stunt they pulled off?"],"953":["Oh wow, that must have been a crazy sight! I heard they were quite audacious in their stunts back then."],"954":["Wow, that's amazing! Dogs are truly incredible creatures. I've heard that some of them can even detect illnesses in humans. The loyalty and intelligence of dogs is really impressive."],"955":["That's interesting. I would never want a breed that sheds a lot. I'm not a fan of cleaning up dog hair all the time."],"956":["It would be great to have a dog that smart! Maybe it would help me learn more about them. Do you have a favorite breed?"],"957":["Wow, that's impressive! Bellamy is definitely a rock star with the most intense stage presence."],"958":["Wow, really? I didn't know that. I can't imagine how much money he must spend on guitars."],"959":["Wow, he must be really energetic on stage to break so many guitars. Have you ever seen him live in concert?"],"960":["I've never been to Iowa, but I heard it's a nice place to visit. The pink locker room must be quite the sight to see!"],"961":["I don't think they would allow that to happen. Their locker room is probably off-limits to opponents."],"962":["None of the players in the National Football League would appreciate playing in an all pink locker room. It would be quite the sight!"],"963":["I couldn't agree more, the variety of shows and movies on Netflix is unbeatable. The thought of not having access to it in certain countries is just the faintest disheartening."],"964":["That's true, Netflix is by far the best streaming service out there. Can you imagine not having access to all those great shows and movies? It would be a real shame."],"965":["Neither do I, I would be really disappointed if I couldn't access my favorite shows on Netflix. I think it's one of the best platforms out there."],"966":["That is a frightening thought. I would have expected security measures to be more efficient. It's a relief to know the President was unharmed."],"967":["I'm not sure about that. In my opinion, the White House should have the best security measures in place at all times. It's a bit alarming to hear that it took them so long to notice."],"968":["That's crazy! It sounds like the secret service needs to up their game. It's like they weren't even paying attention!"],"969":["No way, that's insane! I can't even begin to imagine the amount of technology packed into such a small device. The advancement in technology is mind-blowing, it's hard to wrap my head around the enormity of it all."],"970":["That's incredible! I never would have thought that a phone could have more power than something like that. It's crazy to think about."],"971":["Wow, that's incredible! I never would have imagined that an iPhone could have so much power. It's truly mind-blowing!"],"972":["None of his movies disappoint, do they?"],"973":[" Yes, he's definitely the best actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."],"974":["Isn't he the best Iron Man by far in your opinion?"],"975":["Yeah, I used to listen to it all the time. I would play it on repeat whenever I needed a pick-me-up."],"976":["Not really. Some people actually can't stand it. I guess it depends on personal taste."],"977":["None of my friends do not love it, actually. Some find it quite annoying."],"978":["Yes, I did. It's amazing how much Amazon has grown, becoming the largest online retailer in the world."],"979":["I did know that. Amazon has truly grown into the biggest online retailer without the slightest doubt."],"980":["Yes, I did. It must have been so different back then."],"981":["Yeah, those narrators definitely have iconic voices that make the episodes even more memorable."],"982":["MY BEST FRIEND and I used to watch Thomas the Tank Engine as kids, but we never realized how short those narrations were until now!"],"983":["It's quite impressive that Thomas the Tank Engine even had narrators of that caliber, considering it's a children's show. But I wouldn't say it's the slightest bit surprising, the show is a classic after all."],"984":["Actually, they both really like car rides. My shih tzu gets so excited when I mention going for a drive."],"985":["Not at all! In fact, they absolutely love it. It's like their favorite thing in the world."],"986":["Actually, they love car rides! They're the best little passengers. They always have a blast sticking their heads out the window."],"987":["I don't think there's anyone who can deny that he's incredibly talented."],"988":["If he were to join the Lakers, they would instantly become the most powerful team in the league. His impact on the court is truly remarkable."],"989":["True, but I've never seen a player with so much dedication and skill. He's definitely one of the greatest of all time."],"990":[" That's so kind of him! I wish more players would do things like that. Like using their fame for good causes."],"991":["No, I never heard about that. That's incredibly generous of him to do that for those children."],"992":["No, I hadn't heard about that. That is so generous of him. MY BEST FRIEND would never do something like that, they are not very giving."],"993":["I don't remember exactly, but it must have won quite a few if it's getting this much buzz."],"994":["I'm not sure about the exact number, but I believe it won a bunch of awards."],"995":["I'm not sure, but I remember reading that it won Best Picture."],"996":["That's unbelievable! The biggest mistake in space exploration history, I'm sure."],"997":[" Wow, that sounds like a huge mistake! My best friend works at NASA and I'll ask him about it."],"998":["Oh wow, that's a huge mistake. The loss of communication must have been a disaster. I guess it's a reminder that accuracy is crucial in space exploration. NASA definitely learned a valuable lesson there."],"999":["That's interesting. I didn't know that. Who discovered that information?"],"1000":["I wouldn't have guessed that. Thank you for the information."],"1001":["Wow, I had no idea. That sounds like it is by far the most common elements in the sun."],"1002":["Wow, that's a lot of concerts in one year! I have never seen any band perform that many times."],"1003":["Would you believe that Pink Floyd played not only in an ancient Roman amphitheater, but also in historical venues all around the world during their career?"],"1004":["Wow, that's quite impressive! I didn't realize that Breaking Benjamin and Rise Against had such a busy schedule as well. It's amazing how dedicated some bands can be."],"1005":["That would have been a great idea! I would always watch it if they had a channel with just The Simpsons episodes."],"1006":["That sounds like a great idea. It's a shame not all news networks focus on providing more positive and uplifting content for their viewers."],"1007":["It's a shame they didn't go through with it. I think \"The Simpsons\" could have been one of the best ways to not only entertain viewers, but also to provide a break from all the negativity in the news."],"1008":["That's interesting, I didn't know that. It would be neat to see an old car like that in person."],"1009":["Wow, I never knew that! I wonder if there are any other interesting facts like that about everyday objects."],"1010":["That's interesting. I never thought about why it's called a trunk before. Would you like to watch Jim Carrey's new show sometime?"],"1011":["Yeah, sounds good. You're by far the most knowledgeable about it anyway."],"1012":["Sure, that's fine. I don't have any information on it either."],"1013":["Sure, that would be helpful. Thank you."],"1014":["Good to hear! Did you enjoy the first film as well?"],"1015":["Like a 10, I had such a great time!"],"1016":["By far the most delicious steak I've ever had, how about you?"],"1017":["Haha, exactly! MY BEST FRIEND was the butter knife I always used to separate them."],"1018":["Those phone books were the most cumbersome things to deal with, weren't they? It was such a relief when they switched to online directories."],"1019":["Oh, I remember that! It was the worst, trying to pry them apart without ripping any pages. Thank goodness for online phone directories now, they are so much easier to navigate."],"1020":["Yes, he really was a master of deception. I can't believe he could pull off such a big scam for so many years."],"1021":["Yeah, it's unbelievable how he managed to do it. He was definitely one of the most skilled con artists in history."],"1022":["Yeah, if Hanratty hadn't been so persistent, Frank probably would have kept on going forever. It's amazing how skilled he was at forgery. Can you imagine how much money he made?"],"1023":["It's actually a thought-provoking film with a gripping plot and stellar performances from the cast."],"1024":["My best friend would highly recommend it with great enthusiasm."],"1025":["It was not just fun, it was the most entertaining film I've ever seen."],"1026":["Isn't it incredible how much wealth he has amassed in such a short time? Have you ever thought about what you would do with that kind of money?"],"1027":["Yes, he is definitely one of the most innovative minds of our generation. His contributions to technology are unparalleled."],"1028":["Absolutely, Elon Musk seems to have the brightest ideas, don't you think? He definitely doesn't lack ambition or innovation."],"1029":["Yeah, I guess you could say that safety equipment couldn't handle the safety tests."],"1030":["Yeah, it really is! My best friend always says that safety is key, but this takes it to a whole new level."],"1031":["Well, I wouldn't say it's the safest car out there. I mean, I've never seen a car that's been tested indoors before."],"1032":["Well, I have to say, it's by far the best film I've seen this year."],"1033":["But it was by far the best movie I've seen in a long time."],"1034":["Well, that's surprising! What kind of movies do you usually watch?"],"1035":["No, I haven't heard of Blutube. What is it like?"],"1036":["No, I haven't heard of blutube. Sounds interesting though!"],"1037":["I haven't heard of blutube, what is it? Is it like Youtube, but in a different color theme?"],"1038":["I use the app because it's more convenient for me. I can listen on the go and it doesn't take up much space on my phone. Do you find the web browser easier to navigate?"],"1039":["I use the app because it's more convenient for me. My best friend also uses the app and she says it's the best way to listen to music."],"1040":["I used to use the web browser, but lately I've been using the app more often. It just seems more convenient. How about you?"],"1041":["Absolutely, it was definitely one of the most interesting conversations I've had in a while. And the fact about Baker Mayfield just blew my mind! Take care and have a great day!"],"1042":["I totally get that, not a bad choice to pursue football instead though, right? Don't you think he made the right decision in the end?"],"1043":["You're welcome! I never knew that about Baker Mayfield. It's interesting to hear about the different paths people take. Take care!"],"1044":["That sounds like a fantastic resource. I bet there are some incredibly well-produced radio dramas out there."],"1045":["I believe the Old Time Radio website has the best collection of free radio dramas by far."],"1046":["That sounds like a great idea! Radio dramas have such a unique way of storytelling. Not only can you visualize the scenes in your mind but also the voice acting can really bring the characters to life. By far, I would say radio dramas are one of the most immersive forms of entertainment."],"1047":["It's the strangest movie I have ever seen, to be honest."],"1048":["Well, I used to watch those kinds of movies when I was a teenager. It was a phase, but now I prefer more realistic stories."],"1049":["Why don't we watch a comedy instead? My best friend always says that comedies are the best way to lift your spirits!"],"1050":["Yes, I have. The selection is so wide, it's like a library with everything you could possibly want to read."],"1051":["Yes, I have bought books from Amazon before. It would be so convenient to have them delivered right to your door."],"1052":["I used to order books from Amazon quite often, but I prefer going to bookstores now."],"1053":["Absolutely, I agree. It was a crucial aspect of his character development and added depth to the storyline."],"1054":["I don't think his homosexuality should have been hidden at all. It was not only a crucial aspect of his life, but it also played a significant role in shaping the character's motivations and actions."],"1055":["Wouldn't you say it added depth to the character and made the story more compelling?"],"1056":["Yeah, I did! It's so interesting how Seahorses look like that. But actually, the Black Swallower fish is a deep-sea fish that can eat prey larger than itself. It's pretty fascinating!"],"1057":["Wow, really? That's by far the most fascinating fact I've heard about marine life!"],"1058":["Yes, I did! They are my favorite sea creatures. Don't you think they are the cutest?"],"1059":["I didn't know that. Thank you for sharing that information."],"1060":["No, I never knew that. I would never have guessed that Woodrow Wilson was the only president with a PHD."],"1061":["I didn't know that. Wilson was definitely one of the most educated presidents in US history."],"1062":["I don't think so. Maleficent was rated too low in my opinion. Would you agree?"],"1063":["I would say none of the critics were too pleased with Maleficent. Not all of them appreciated its unique take on the classic tale."],"1064":["I wouldn't say that. I think Maleficent was one of the best Disney movies of that year. It had a great storyline and amazing special effects."],"1065":["Wow, really? I never knew that! It's interesting to hear about the unique interactions between world leaders."],"1066":["Wow, that's cool! I didn't know Fidel Castro wrote letters as a boy. Don't you find it fascinating to learn about these historical connections?"],"1067":["Wow, really? That's fascinating. I would always wonder what kind of things were said in those letters. It must have been quite an experience for them receiving such correspondence."],"1068":["MY BEST FRIEND, I think it's crazy how someone could underestimate his potential like that!"],"1069":["Yeah, it's definitely ironic that the same people who didn't think he looked presidential ended up electing him as their leader. Life works in mysterious ways sometimes."],"1070":["Exactly! It's like something out of a movie, right?"],"1071":["If you ever come over, I would love to make some queso fundido for you."],"1072":["It's definitely one of the best cheesy dishes I have ever had!"],"1073":["It's the best appetizer I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant!"],"1074":["Yeah, she did an amazing job embodying the complexity of her character."],"1075":["She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood."],"1076":["She was the perfect choice for the role, don't you think?"],"1077":["Indeed, I heard it picks up quite nicely with cleverly timed comedic scenes."],"1078":["I guess more of the same could actually be pretty entertaining then. Would you like to watch it together sometime?"],"1079":["Yes, the reviewer mentioned that the second half is considered one of the funniest moments in the history of cinema."],"1080":["I go to a very serious and professional table tennis club. The players there take their game very seriously and practice diligently ;)"],"1081":["I do not go to a club often, but I can play table tennis with friends in the park sometimes."],"1082":["I go to a professional table tennis club, where all the top players train. It's the best club in the city with top-notch facilities and coaches."],"1083":["Yes, I do enjoy watching horror movies. They always get my heart racing and I guess that's how the calories burn!"],"1084":["Yes, I do watch horror movies occasionally. That's intriguing to know that watching a horror movie would burn that many calories."],"1085":["MY BEST FRIEND loves horror movies so I watch them with her sometimes. I'm not a big fan of them, but I'd be willing to give it a try. But burning 200 calories? I don't think that's true!"],"1086":["Absolutely, he would definitely loathe that prospect even more than the guest house being larger than the White House."],"1087":["Yeah, she would by far be his biggest rival."],"1088":["Absolutely! Like, she would definitely make some big changes if she were to become President, wouldn't she?"],"1089":["Oh, yes! Emma Stone would always do a great job in comedies."],"1090":["I disagree, Emma Stone was not only good in Superbad but also delivered one of the best performances in La La Land."],"1091":["Oh, right! Emma Stone was fantastic in Superbad. I wonder if she would have won an award for that performance."],"1092":["I agree, I used to spend hours surfing the web every day."],"1093":["Absolutely! It is definitely one of the biggest challenges in today's digital age."],"1094":["That's true, but I've never had the faintest desire to spend hours on the internet."],"1095":["Definitely! However, not only would it be chaotic, but it could also create even more division among the people. None of us would want that, right?"],"1096":["Haha, not a chance! Don't you think that would make for some interesting political drama?"],"1097":["Haha, that would be quite the drama! Not only would we have a female vice president, but we would also have an unconventional president. Not all TV shows could compete with that level of entertainment."],"1098":["I think exposing him to different perspectives would definitely broaden his horizons."],"1099":["It would be nice for him to see a hero who stands up for justice, even if he's different from others."],"1100":["I've never seen a superhero movie with such a powerful message about acceptance and inclusion."],"1101":["Canine Companions really did go above and beyond to make sure the service dogs had the best day ever at Disneyland!"],"1102":["I wouldn't be surprised if Pluto wished he could join the service dogs for a fun day out at Disneyland."],"1103":["Pluto must have been by far the happiest dog in Disneyland that day, wouldn't he?"],"1104":["Wow, that's incredible! I wonder if that means our phones are more powerful than some of the supercomputers from the past."],"1105":["Don't you find it absolutely mind-blowing that a small device like an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear icbm deterrent? It's the slightest bit unsettling, don't you think?"],"1106":["Wow, that's impressive - I had no idea! None of my devices could match that kind of computing power. "],"1107":["MY BEST FRIEND thinks that the justice system should be fair for everyone, no matter how much money they have. Treason should be punished, but in a way that respects human rights. It's important to uphold the rule of law even when dealing with serious crimes like espionage or sedition."],"1108":["By far the harshest punishment for treason is death. But we do not believe in capital punishment here. Treason is a serious crime, but we cannot stoop to their level by executing them for it. There are other ways to ensure justice is served."],"1109":["Absolutely. The concept of justice is unfortunately often distorted by power and privilege. In a perfect world, corrupt officials would not only lose their heads but also be stripped of all their ill-gotten gains. Don't you think that would be the ultimate punishment for those who abuse their positions?"],"1110":["That's true, but I prefer having a variety of options to choose from. I think radio is too limited for me."],"1111":["That's true, radio definitely has its advantages. Maybe I should give it another chance. It sounds like you have a lot of options for listening to music!"],"1112":["That's true, radio does have its advantages. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, but I still think streaming services are more convenient overall."],"1113":["Ah, the Bucks are playing exceptionally well this season then. Would you say they are consistently outperforming their opponents?"],"1114":["Oh wow, the Milwaukee Bucks have been by far the most impressive team this season. I would definitely keep an eye on them."],"1115":["Oh, really? I wouldn't have guessed that. Have the Milwaukee Bucks always been that good?"],"1116":["Like, I would imagine that a company with a strong infrastructure and resources could possibly succeed in the distribution area."],"1117":["If they were able to secure efficient distribution channels, they would have a much better chance of success."],"1118":["I would say Netflix has definitely mastered the art of content distribution."],"1119":["That's true.  It was definitely one of the most underrated sitcoms of the 90s."],"1120":["It's true. 3rd Rock from the Sun was by far the most underrated comedy series of the 90s."],"1121":["If more people had watched it, maybe it would have become even more popular."],"1122":["I can understand that sentiment, the pressure of being nominated can be overwhelming and disappointing if you don't win."],"1123":["But don't you think being nominated is still an honor in itself?"],"1124":["That's a fair point, sometimes it's better to not have the pressure of expectations."],"1125":["He really is! One of the funniest actors of all time, in my opinion. Thanks for the chat!"],"1126":["I agree, Bill Murray is a legend in comedy. Have a great day!"],"1127":["Yes, I agree, Bill Murray is definitely a legend in comedy. Thanks for the chat, it was the most enjoyable conversation I've had in a while!"],"1128":["I think it's because their star power brings in more viewers and makes the movie more appealing. Plus, having a celebrity voice can really elevate the quality of the film."],"1129":["Well, some people think that having a celebrity voice adds more appeal to the movie, but I personally don't think it matters that much. Do you agree?"],"1130":["Yeah, it's true that not every celebrity can pull off voice acting like Robin Williams did in Aladdin. Neither the fame nor the talent!"],"1131":["Indeed, the internal struggle of the character as a \"lone wolf\" is portrayed with incredible depth and complexity."],"1132":["I think it would be good to see the main character as a wolf if it symbolizes strength and independence."],"1133":["I would say that being a \"wolf\" is often associated with negative characteristics like aggressiveness and ruthlessness. However, there can be times when being a \"wolf\" could be seen as a positive trait in terms of ambition and determination."],"1134":["Definitely! I think it's one of the best design choices. The simplicity of the hamburger button makes navigation so much easier."],"1135":["Actually, I don't surf the internet that much. And yes, the hamburger button naming is quite interesting."],"1136":["I don't surf the internet too much, it takes away from my cat video watching time. And yes, the term \"hamburger button\" does sound pretty funny."],"1137":["That movie would always remind me of how the superhero genre evolved over time."],"1138":["If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend checking it out. Christian Bale's performance is remarkable."],"1139":[" Would you say that it's Bale's best performance yet?"],"1140":["None of the other characters could carry the show on their own like Bart could."],"1141":["Wow, really? I had no idea! If you could choose one character from The Simpsons as your favorite, who would it be?"],"1142":["Really? I didn't know that. Don't you think it's impressive how long the show has been on the air?"],"1143":["I agree with you that the trolls were silly, but I think not only young children but also adults can still learn valuable lessons from them."],"1144":["That's true. The trolls were definitely the most entertaining characters in the film."],"1145":["I don't think the trolls were the silliest characters in the movie. I think Olaf is the silliest one by far."],"1146":["No, I didn't know that! That's really interesting. I wonder if they serve the same purpose as the White House in the United States."],"1147":["Wow, I had no idea! That's really interesting. It's crazy to think about all the hidden secrets and interesting facts about famous buildings like the White House. It must be fascinating to learn about them."],"1148":["That's interesting! I would love to see those twin buildings someday. It must be quite unique to have identical buildings in different countries."],"1149":["That is not true. How can they save the entire internet in one place? It must be a rumor."],"1150":["I wouldn't have thought of that. It's quite interesting and a smart move for preserving information."],"1151":["I would have never thought of that! It's amazing how much information is stored on the internet."],"1152":["NONE of the models I would consider buying, I prefer vehicles with a different operating system."],"1153":["Yeah, it would make more sense to test them outdoors to see how they perform in real conditions."],"1154":["Exactly, it's strange that they wouldn't test them in real-life conditions. I would never buy a car that hasn't been thoroughly tested in all environments."],"1155":["I would like to learn more about it, but it sounds a bit intimidating to think about exploring such a place like that. What do you think?"],"1156":["I can't imagine there being an area in space that's even the slightest bit hospitable for life as we know it."],"1157":["If they do get pulled by that region, then it's a scary thought. I would never go anywhere near there, not even for the slightest moment."],"1158":["Yes, it was a surprising victory for India. Ice hockey is a popular sport in many cold countries."],"1159":["Yes, hockey was definitely more popular in India back then. It was actually considered one of the best teams in the world. They would always perform well in international competitions."],"1160":["Not a lot of people know about India's hockey success, but they were a force to be reckoned with. Don't you find it surprising?"],"1161":["I've never heard of registered superheroes in the United States. It's interesting to think about."],"1162":["That's interesting. I would have thought that being a superhero was more of a secretive profession. Did you know that some NFL players also struggle with financial problems after retirement?"],"1163":["Yeah, it's crazy how many superheroes there are out there. I would like to meet one someday, it must be really cool."],"1164":["Yes, he must have had exceptional skills to excel at that level in college.  No wonder he became such a successful comedian later on."],"1165":["I wonder if he still plays for fun now."],"1166":["I think so, yeah. I would like to see some old footage of him playing. Maybe he was really good."],"1167":["Elisa's dedication to the creature was truly admirable. She was definitely one of the most determined characters in the film."],"1168":["That sounds like something she would do. She always goes above and beyond for him."],"1169":["That was the most courageous thing she could have done in that situation."],"1170":["Yes, I absolutely loved it! The storyline was incredibly captivating and the acting was top-notch."],"1171":["Actually, I would never watch that movie again. It was just not my cup of tea."],"1172":["I wouldn't say I enjoyed it in the slightest."],"1173":["If you ever find that book, would you mind lending it to me? I would love to read more about the history he was passionate about."],"1174":["Wow, Kareem Abdul-Jabar is not only a fantastic basketball player but also an accomplished historian. That's amazing!"],"1175":["That's amazing! I would love to read that book. He must have a lot of interesting stories to share."],"1176":["That's impressively boring! She once traveled to 20 countries in one year."],"1177":["Wouldn't you say that her background played a huge role in shaping her music career?"],"1178":["Wow, I would never have guessed that. That's quite surprising."],"1179":["Yes, it's heartbreaking to see anyone, especially kids, being made to feel like they don't belong. It's important for them to feel accepted and supported in order to have the best chance at success and happiness."],"1180":["I can understand your concern. It's important for kids to feel safe and accepted for who they are. Bullying can have long-lasting effects on a person's self-esteem."],"1181":["It's definitely tough to see anyone being mistreated, especially kids who are just trying to navigate their way through the world. I think it would be one of the best things to educate children early on about acceptance and diversity."],"1182":["No, I don't have a Facebook account. Neither do I have any other social media profiles."],"1183":["No, I don't have a Facebook account. I prefer to stay off social media."],"1184":["No, I actually don't have a Facebook account, I prefer to keep my social media presence limited. My best friend neither has Facebook nor Twitter, she values her privacy."],"1185":["I am not a big fan of movies that glamorize such important social issues for the sake of entertainment."],"1186":["Yes, they always include LGBT elements, by far the most well-researched and accurate representations I have seen in any films so far."],"1187":["None of the characters are stereotyped and the representation is realistic and respectful of the LGBT community."],"1188":["If she has achieved all that success, she must have worked incredibly hard."],"1189":["Wow, that's impressive! Doesn't she have an incredible voice?"],"1190":["Wow, that's incredible! I've never heard of anyone achieving such success in that genre."],"1191":["I do not, historical movies are not really my thing."],"1192":["None of them are as visually stunning as this one, with intricate details and incredible cinematography."],"1193":["I don't think there's any historical movie that can be more impactful than The Post."],"1194":["That's amazing! None of the other jazz venues can compare to the intimacy of a concert in someone's home like that."],"1195":["That's incredible! Hosting jazz concerts at one's home is truly a wonderful and unique way to share the love for music."],"1196":["That sounds amazing! I would love to attend one of those concerts sometime."],"1197":["Not the faintest idea that lightning could be that scorching! It's incredible to think about."],"1198":["That would be extremely dangerous. I heard that lightning is one of the most powerful natural phenomena on Earth."],"1199":["Oh no, I can't imagine how hot that must be!
