I would really love to see a dog learn all those words, it's definitely a unique talent. But, I have to say, I'm more impressed by the fact that some dogs can learn to be service animals, that's certainly incredible!\""],"3":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: But not every dog can learn that many words, right?"],"4":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\n\"A, that's amazing! I would have loved to see that dog learn all those words. My best friend's dog is actually a genius, she can do tricks and even fetch items from another room. Would you believe it? She's the smartest dog I've ever seen!\""],"5":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\n\"A, that's amazing! I would take my GSD to the park every day when I was a kid, and it was always a highlight of my day. Not only would we play fetch, but also we'd have long walks and I'd learn so much about responsibility. It's incredible how much they can learn, isn't it?\""],"6":["A: But I don't think they can mount flame throwers on their cars in South Africa, it's not allowed by law."],"7":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I think if I were in that competition, I would be really nervous, but that driver must be my best friend if he can beat so many people!"],"8":["A: That's incredible! I would never have thought that someone could become a professional race car driver through a video game."],"9":["A: That's incredible! He must be the most skilled gamer in the world to beat 90,000 people in a video game, to become a professional."],"10":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see him compete in the most prestigious racing tournaments in the world, like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to prove his skills."],"11":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would love to see a car with a flame thrower, but I think it's not a good idea to have one on the road."],"12":["A: I can imagine! The most intense experience must be quite overwhelming."],"13":["A: I can imagine! The most terrifying experience must be the storm surge, don't you think?"],"14":["A: I wouldn't worry about it too much, though - I've lived in the upper midwest all my life, where the most extreme weather we get is occasional blizzards."],"15":["A: I can imagine! The most intense experience must be quite overwhelming."],"16":["A: I can imagine it's a lot more intense living on the southern coast, where you're more likely to experience the strongest hurricanes. Would you say that's the most challenging part of living there, dealing with the threat of natural disasters?"],"17":["A: Wow, that's really intense! I would have been terrified if I were in your shoes. What was it like, living through a hurricane?"],"18":["I would definitely agree with you that the Minions are the most entertaining part of the movie."],"19":["A: I think the Minions are actually the most hilarious characters in the whole Despicable Me franchise, and I would recommend watching the movies just for their scenes."],"20":["A: Not only did I love the Minions, but I would have also loved to have seen more of their silly antics in the movie."],"21":["A: But I don't think it's just the yellow minions that make the movie funny, not every scene with them is hilarious."],"22":["A: I think the Minions are actually the most entertaining part of the whole franchise, to be honest, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge fan of bananas!"],"23":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\n\"A: I think the Minions are the most entertaining characters in the whole franchise, don't you? I would have loved to have seen more of them in the first movie, but I guess they were saving them for the spin-off. Not only did they steal the show in Despicable Me 2, but they also made the third movie a huge success.\""],"24":["A: That's true, it's not a very practical building, but it's still an iconic symbol of the country's government."],"25":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't really know, but probably they're used for exhibitions or events, definitely not as offices or homes. I don't think it's possible to live or work there, it's just too small."],"26":["A: That's really interesting! I think the White House is the most famous one, but I've heard that the one in India, Rashtrapati Bhavan, is the largest and most impressive one. Would it be a good idea to visit them all and compare their architecture? I can't imagine how many people would be interested in seeing all of them, but it would be a unique experience."],"27":["A: That's fascinating! The White House is the most famous building in the world, and it's interesting to know that it's not very practical for its purposes. I've heard that the largest White House in the world is in Brasilia, Brazil, and it's used as a museum."],"28":["A: That's really interesting! I think the White House is the most iconic building in the world, and it's amazing that there are twin buildings in other countries. I would love to visit them one day, but I'm not sure if they're as historic as the one in Washington D.C."],"29":["A: That's really interesting! I would have loved to see the White House up close, but I didn't have the chance. I've always been fascinated by the history of the building, and I would often visit it if I lived in Washington D.C.

I would have thought that the law would have been passed much more recently, given how popular the legend of the Loch Ness monster is."],"33":["A: That's amazing! I think it's the most fascinating thing I've ever heard."],"34":["A: That's hilarious! But actually, I think it's even more surprising that the Scottish government has been protecting the Loch Ness monster for over a century, without any concrete evidence of its existence."],"35":["A: That's hilarious! I would love to see a picture of the Loch Ness monster. Would you like to go to Scotland and try to find it?"],"36":["I would love to learn more about how it works, like, step by step!"],"37":["A: That's incredible!

And speaking of extremes, did you know that Jupiter's radio storms are the most intense in the entire solar system, with some reaching as high as 100,000 kilometers per hour?"],"39":["A: Would you like to try building a simple radio together, just for fun?"],"40":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\nA: I completely agree, it's mind-blowing to think that the most powerful radio signals in the solar system are coming from Jupiter, and I don't think I'd ever get tired of listening to them, even if I had to tune in to the most obscure station on the planet!"],"41":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\nA: I would love to visit Finland and listen to that station, but I think I would prefer to explore the beautiful nature there instead."],"42":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Not every team can rely on height to gain an advantage, but it's certainly a significant factor in basketball, isn't it?"],"43":["A: Would you like to know how good they are?"],"44":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\nA: Yeah, I'd say they're probably the best team in the world, considering their height advantage and the fact that they've been doing well for a long time."],"45":["A: Would you like to imagine what it would have been like to watch the Tall Blacks play back in the day, when they were the only team with that kind of height advantage?"],"46":["I'd really like to know more about their performance in international competitions, but I'm not sure if they're as good as their rugby team, which is definitely one of the best in the world."],"47":["\"I'd say they're probably the best team in the world, considering their height advantage and the fact that they've been playing together for so long. But, to be honest, I don't think it's just about being tall - they must have a strong team spirit and good coaching too.\""],"48":["A: That's true, but not all of them are Michael Phelps, there are many other talented swimmers out there."],"49":["A: That's amazing! I would love to visit Cornell University one day, it's one of the best universities in the world, and I've heard the campus is beautiful, especially in the fall when the leaves change color in Ithaca."],"50":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to have met Michael Phelps, he's my best friend's idol. Not only did he win a record number of gold medals, but he also broke so many world records."],"51":["A: Would you believe that President Andrew Johnson's wife had to teach him how to read?"],"52":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\n\"A, that's amazing! I don't think I would have guessed that about President Johnson. And wow, the US having almost as many gold medals in swimming as the world combined is incredible! I'm actually surprised you don't follow swimming more closely, given your location. Have you ever tried swimming in the Great Lakes?\""],"53":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to have seen President Andrew Johnson's learning process. Did he ever regret not being able to read? Not only did he have to rely on his wife, but also on others to read out loud to him."],"54":["A: Yeah, it was definitely suspicious. Not everyone was convinced it was just a coincidence, but I think it's not every conspiracy theory that's worth investigating."],"55":["A: Yeah, it was super weird, and I think it's the most bizarre movie release strategy ever, without any explanation or warning, it just appeared online."],"56":["A: Yeah, it was really weird, and I think it's because Sony would have been worried that people would boycott the movie if they knew about the hacking scandal beforehand. Can't blame them, really, but it's still a shame because it would have been a great opportunity to show that they could take a joke and move on."],"57":["A: Yeah, it was super weird, but I think it's because it was released in North Korea, which is the most isolated country in the world, and they didn't want any negative publicity."],"58":["A: I would have loved to know what was going on behind the scenes, but unfortunately, it's all just speculation now."],"59":["A: Yeah, it was really weird, and I think it's because Sony would have lost a lot of money if it had been released normally."]},"time":{"0":1.7517020702,"1":2.8241143227,"2":4.0765805244,"3":1.6245148182,"4":4.2423214912,"5":5.0202300549,"6":1.8600184917,"7":2.538230896,"8":1.8939085007,"9":2.1925055981,"10":7.0645375252,"11":2.8389678001,"12":1.1695137024,"13":1.6259818077,"14":2.5973758698,"15":1.2835884094,"16":3.2954535484,"17":2.5287337303,"18":1.3986685276,"19":2.2027630806,"20":1.9711248875,"21":1.8603260517,"22":2.5918579102,"23":5.2353057861,"24":1.8519120216,"25":3.0551319122,"26":5.1183152199,"27":3.8606398106,"28":4.0029740334,"29":5.4515562057,"30":1.9092297554,"31":3.2159836292,"32":2.3572826385,"33":1.5132396221,"34":2.7841691971,"35":2.5593571663,"36":1.2927293777,"37":2.2831754684,"38":4.6455714703,"39":1.2830135822,"40":4.4174659252,"41":2.6094260216,"42":2.4188742638,"43":0.9972851276,"44":2.939977169,"45":2.4272184372,"46":2.7576861382,"47":4.1184420586,"48":1.7743275166,"49":3.1778900623,"50":3.0392482281,"51":1.3990571499,"52":4.7529616356,"53":3.7226805687,"54":2.1924030781,"55":2.3149569035,"56":4.2989366055,"57":2.7622203827,"58":1.9522924423,"59":2.4426252842}}
