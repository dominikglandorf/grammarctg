I mean look at the CinemaScore, it gave Home Alone an A.","But it can also be accurate! Do you think that the plot could be predicted before the scene when Kevin wishes his family would disappear? Or did that scene make you realize what was happening... or even maybe you didn't realize it until it happened?","That scene made me realize what was about to happen.

Almost as crazy as knowing the first president to be photographed for the inauguration was Lincoln and ironically, Wilkes Booth was in that very photo!","Could you imagine if any of our Presidents made an album, although Bill Clinton could have released a jazz album, he was pretty good on the sax.

It was interesting.  I wonder whose idea it was.","I'm not sure.  Perhaps one of the reasons basketball is such a draw is that minimal equipment is required to play, unlike football which required uniforms, pads, helmet, etc.  So, basically anyone with a pair of athletic shoes can play.

How do you think Steven Speilberg compares to other American filmmakers?","I think he's very good at manipulating an audiences' feelings in a way that benefits his movies. For example, I wasn't too upset when the shark attacked the victims.\n ","I agree, but I do like how the victims caused enough fear in the Police Chief to close the beaches and enough fear in the Mayor that the town would lose money from a lack of tourists to re-open them.

Have you watched any World Cup events, I haven't. My friends in Europe say the country shuts down for their team's matches. Strange that the hosting company don't show any net economic gains though. Sounds like bad planning.","462":"Yes, they loved the price, the delivery date was the problem. They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.

","470":"If I had a job where someone told me I had to leave simply because a player of the same team came in, I would be so ticked. ","471":"True!

What would you do with all that spare time?","503":"How would they promote ideas, just in the plays they produce or in advertising in the pamphlet they pass out? ","504":"Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for?","505":"Yeah, it's hard to break the habit.

Would you ever end up accepting a ride with a traveling polka band to get around being stranded like that?","524":"I would love to see women in MLB.  While I don't think wide adoption could ever be possible in football, baseball has no real reason why they would be completely excluded, and would be the most likely to break that barrier.","525":"What are you talking about? I get up early every morning at 6 o'clock AM?","526":"Come on, buddy, cheer up. Why not do some sports with me?

What do you think about the dean failing both Mike and Sulley at the end of the semester?","585":"Another instance of unfairness is when Stanley Kubrick didn't get credit for his cinematography work for spartacus.

At least, that's my assumption","657":"I would have sold them. Are you a heavy internet user?","658":"I would have thought they would be ranked higher.  They are so iconic.  Are all the band members still alive?","659":"Maybe they did? I don't think that crushing defeat would have happened if Bill Belichick was their coach!  The guy is a football wizard. Winningest coach in postseason history!","660":"It sounds so familiar but if I seen it, it would have been years ago.  Is it older movie?","661":"Wow, not that long ago.

","668":"Dang I had that game for nintendo! I wish I would have kept the classics, I am sure they are worth a lot!","669":"I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional \"New England resort town\".

When he visited India all the coconuts in the trees surrounding him were removed, I assume so they wouldn't fall on him.","763":"Sometimes people think that they're helping when they don't realize that they are in fact destroying a legacy.

You don't have to worry about it.","831":"I think they mean currently....Vick was too...lol  What is the reason for the circular huddle?","832":"They call the genre speculative fiction.","833":"I agree with them as well","834":"Then would you like to have lunch with us?","835":"I do like to, but don't get to do as much as I would like, how about you?","836":"thats cool","837":"Would you recommend I see this movie with kids?\n ","838":"That's nuts. Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun","839":"I think so. I guess we invented clothing and did not need it anymore","840":"OK. Bye.","841":"They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.","842":"That is true","843":":)","844":"Sorry. Can you please help me up! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on.","845":"how about you ever visit Europe","846":"With the way the internet works these days I think it would spread like wildfire.","847":"I have cats. I had dogs growing up but we have a lot of stray cats around my home and we took a couple in so now we are out of pet space. ","848":"You do well in maths, but your history is not good enough. Am I right?","849":"Well, they were two \"freaks\" of sorts, so that is understandable","850":"Ok. Just call me if you need anything then.","851":"My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself. Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily. If you have friends or relatives here, ask them for help, too.","852":"If you can't beat them, join them. I guess that's what the FBI did. Must be a cool story. Did you see it in the theater?","853":"Otis Elevator invented the \"safety elevator\" in 1852, which uses a mechanism to lock the elevator if the ropes fail.","854":"That's wonderful, sir. Now, here's your key. Should you need anything, just dial 0.","855":"If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.","856":"If you need anything else, just let me know.","857":"Well, I bet you will love them too. If you need help, just ask me any time. I am in the next door. You can also reach me through the extension 508.","858":"Well, if you need anything, just let me know.","859":"If you ever get a chance to visit the Loop, check out the Chicago Symphony Orchesta, the Joffrey Ballet, or the Cutler center!","860":"If you have any question, you can ask me.","861":"Thank you. I have to leave now. If you see Pamela, tell her I'll write to her.","862":"If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way.","863":"If you really want to learn, remind me when you get back from your business trip.","864":"That's wonderful, sir. Now, here's your key. Should you need anything, just dial 0.","865":"Well. if you think I can help, let me know.","866":"Ha ha that is funny me too. If you own an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty by making it a biohazard.","867":"If you are satisfied with the conditions here, please sign this contract and give it to me.","868":"Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered promptly.","869":"There's are a lot of artificial sweetners in diet coke. If you mix it with rum, be sure to stir it well as it has a tendency to sit on the top.","870":"I love Japanese ballgames. They have so much fun. It's like a rock concert. If you ever get board, youtube it. It's so fun!","871":"you're welcome. And we have 24 hour reception. Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions.","872":"Here's my card, just give me a call if you're interested.","873":"If you are bored, stop by and see if you get a chance to see google's latest crazy stunt like the time they used hundreds of goats to mow their lawn.","874":"If you need a package on Sunday, no problem!  Amazon has a contract with the USPS to get it to you.","875":"That sounds like it's really good. Is this a sequel?","876":"President Willaim Henry Harrison he only served 32 days. Do you know which president happened to also be an actor previously","877":"def beef steak.","878":"Sounds like a great idea. Hope you find something that works.","879":"We must have read the same article.  I remember that, as well as that hiccups are  a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs.","880":"You know, now that I think about it, you might be right.","881":"Perfect. We don't have to listen to dogs barking in the evenings.","882":"It does! I really enjoy movies that show different perspectives and how the people interact together.","883":"No in the picture their veins are huge! You should look it up if your squeamish. ","884":"Sure. Come on it. We just finished rebuilding everything.","885":"Well thanks so much for chatting. I learned a lot of new and interesting information.","886":"Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment.","887":"Wow, goes to show you can always learn something new each day. Do you know if they have big cattle farms to rear them or are they small family farms?","888":"That's amazing! Really? How could it change so much in two days?","889":"and sadly it receives the least amount of funding. ","890":"The sneaky guy Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid and only true love can save her. ","891":"not much info there","892":"Why not?","893":"You're welcome. Have a nice trip.","894":"There's also an ethics spin on going to a plant based diet, not harming animals and what not","895":"i can see why people like a lot on, but anything but a deep pan pizza, that is not pizza","896":"I agree with that. I always enjoyed the classics, but I find myself reading more Sci Fi true crime now. ","897":"And I'm pretty young, but I can still appreciate that the effects were good for its time.","898":"Along with 250+ million players in 200 countries and millions more who don't\/didn't play but are still fans! What is a corner shot?","899":"You look wonderful. ","900":"They overslept because the power went out and their alarm clocks reset. That would not have happened if they had cell phones. ","901":"At least those shows survived. Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989. If those shows had been on CC, they might have disappeared.","902":"That would have me worried if I were President.  Well, its been good chatting with you.  Its Mardi Gras down here!","903":"If I was a musciian I would be ok with playing music I didn't really care for if it paid the bills...","904":"ya they claim that it makes their product a \"biohazard\" and that is why they void the warranty, ya it would be interesting if we had no computers for sure","905":"I'd take it if I were you.","906":"Reading books is useful to remember history.  Annie Jones could read 4,700 words per minute.  Imagine how up to date with current events and history she could be if she read all day, or at least as much as she could read all day.","907":"I'd be super upset if I was the guy from Myspace for not buying it when I had the chance. ","908":"If I had a pig, I'd probably treat it like a dog too. They are very smart and very clean animals, despite popular though. George Clooney is actually a distant relative of Lincoln too.","909":"I agree, I feel like if I had a family that large, I would be checking and counting constantly to make sure I had all of my family members always present.","910":"I think if the movie was released in our current time , it would of been boycotted","911":"If shoes were made like they were 5000 years ago they'd all last.  Apparently 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.","912":"Oh wow! Did he give them up for adoption, or did he keep all the kittens? I don't think I could say goodbye to any of them if that was me! Yeah totally, they'll be young enough to live good lives with owners and no issues trying to find food for themselves!","913":"If I could do it in the morning, then that would be good.","914":"If I had a water hole to bathe in, I probably would do it! It would be nice to bathe in hot springs too.","915":"Haha, I know right. Maybe if we used FB like Iceland does, to do useful things like rewrite the constitution, I would be more of a FB fan.","916":"I didn't know Bill played the sax! That's pretty cool. Speaking of Bill, it's a good thing he was never president of Guatemala as close relatives of former presidents aren't allowed to run so no one in his family could if we were Guatemala.","917":"If you had to choose your favorite president from Ohio, who would it be?","918":"That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94. 35 RIB.","919":"I wonder what he would have to say if the room were filled with only black female reporters as suggested.","920":"That would be great if we did. I think the director John Lasseter did an amazing job with this movie and writing technique.","921":"Yeah, Blockbuster was a big part of my childhood. Too bad! And if Reed Hastings had been better about late fees, the world might have been completely different!","922":"Yes I think that band was Creed correct? if I were them I would have been so embarrassed I would never have toured again","923":"Right. And if I were rapping that fast, I would think, wait, what did I just say? Does it even make sense? Haha.","924":"ya I would feel weird if my sister were better than me at sports haha, ","925":"It was for 4","926":"I think chess should qualify given its history and complexity","927":"Really? that rule is so unfair, that makes me really angry in this time and age it should be allowed that is a terrible rule","928":"Wow.  And that is largely caused by Obesity","929":"That sounds so amazingly delicious, a quick fact  The term \"burger\" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own.","930":"I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.","931":"That's kind of bizarre. She was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year at the Grammy's ","932":"I'm not sure if it is still used today, but I do know that images on film stock  are played back at a rapid speed and projected onto a screen","933":"\nhahahahaha steals the moon !!! ?? amazing","934":"maybe i have heard about it. i just do not recall :)","935":"That's crazy to me. that and James Earl Jones only go tpaid $7500 for 2.5 hours of work!","936":"When you think of Batman, you always think that the Joker. But this movie does not really play on that relationship.","937":"Wow, that's interesting. Do you happen to know what is the fastest completion of the Tour de France. My guess is Lance Armstrong?","938":"Not really, but I am sure you could look it up. I personally like the episode with the 3 eyed fish","939":"Sounds complicated.  Do truck drivers have to buy and provide their own trucks?","940":"based on the descriptions I see in the docs I'm given","941":"Cool, do you know how long Justin Beiber has been performing?","942":"May I have your room number, please?","943":"Well if he ran against Trump and there were no other candidates I might consider it lol","944":"this is family drama","945":"I know, right.  I think it's not banned anymore now. You know much more about basketball, I would love to hear more interesting facts.","946":"Did you hear they are making a sequel?","947":"I need to come in right away. ","948":"True. Did you know that the vast majority of bird species are monogamous, some just for one breeding season, others for years or even for life. From penguins to cardinals...","949":"Who started the modern Olympics?","950":"I think it has a lot to do with the cast, to be honest. Meryl and Tom and Sarah Paulson as well. If they didn't get those larger names, more people would have ignored it.","951":"Of course, if his adversary who challenged him had won, things would not have turned out to be so lucrative for him. ","952":"I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.","953":"I could have had a farm of my own if I'd stayed there.","954":"These toys brought awareness to the idea of self-realization. had he known who he was, he never would have made that attempt.","955":"You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!","956":"I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally. ","957":"Thank you ! If I had not taken action when I did, I would have needed a crown. Its much more expensive. Luckily there was no tooth decay  Thus dentists make a killing on teeth","958":"That is, if Elsa had learned to master her magic rather than ignore it, it would have been a very different story.","959":"Oh! Smart cookie you are! And I absolutely agree he was. Without him and Kristoff, there would not have been an amazing movie!","960":"I am sorry, Bob. If you had told me you were coming up, I would have kept tonight free. But you didn't tell me.","961":"if he didn't try to help his friends and ratted them out he would have done a lot less time","962":"I wonder who it was! If he had a beard, he would have been republican.","963":"Cool.    If he were in the States, he would have seen a lot of baseball in that lifespan!","964":"I agree. I thought it was interesting how quickly the coroner changed the cause of death for Chrissie. Although, I guess if he hadn't, there would have been much of a movie. ","965":"I felt like if people hadn't kept mistreating the creature, maybe the creature would have decided to use his powers for the good of society as a whole. But instead, the villain mistreated him to where he just wanted to do anything to avoid people at all. ","966":"I thought her decision to resign was the right decision at the time although not the best idea. Had she not resigned, I think even worse things would have happened. What about you?","967":"Honestly, If I had known when I was a kid that I was gonna still be alive at my age, I'd have taken a lot better care of myself!","968":"Oh definitely, I feel like the advent of Facebook pretty much spelled the end for MySpace. If Facebook hadn\u2019t come about, MySpace would probably have remained a lot more popular. And I agree, I had always been given the impression that Zuckerberg came up with the idea of Facebook all on his own and started it all by himself, so it was neat to see that there had been multiple other people involved in its conception.","969":"I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'","970":"Honestly if it weren't for how tough and low paying it sometimes is, I'd probably have gone to culinary school.","971":"If it weren't for my job, I would have quit a long time ago. There's no upside for me to be on it. I was surprised to know the reason their colors are blue and white.","972":"I also believe karma works. So, when Regina gets hurt - that's karma. We don't always see it so clearly and obviously, of course. I don't really know if anything like that happened at my high school. By that point I was so thoroughly and completely ostracized they could have burnt the school down and I wouldn't have known a thing about it until I arrived for class the next day. ","973":"You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!","974":"No, I'm sure Trump hasn't allowed any of that!  Things would surely have been different if Hillary had won the election.","975":"Because they can pick up on our emotions. They have been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors.","976":"That's pretty cool. The average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay!","977":"Actually, I do, I  believe it was JFK, Washington and Jefferson.  Think Wash and Jefferson were wealthy from land\/farming and JFK well, he inherited money from a bootlegging empire.  ","978":"Seems like it just came out a couple years ago. haha","979":"I wonder if they even have a Burger King, I'm sure they do but it's not a very large country and I feel like they are pretty health conscious from my research into traveling there.","980":"I don't know if it has. I'd be a little scared to ride in a bus going that fast, I wonder how it would be rated for safety (and the safety of cars on the road too).","981":"Yeah that would be a ton to keep track of! Do you use a telephone by the way? I bet they definitely had to to schedule those games haha","982":"I hope you are not a fan, but in my opinion you know the chances you are taking by buying a Creed ticket.","983":"unfortunately not. If I can't find anything in the field, then I could also work in the tourism field.","984":"It's hard to top the originals sometimes, especially when the culture changes so much over time and the excitement just isn't there.","985":"I did not know that. Crazy how it has been adopted everywhere now! You know what I would like to see get adopted everywhere? Equipping cars with flamethrowers! They actually allow that in South Africa! ","986":"Yeah I bet Europeans were weirded out at first. Now everyone smokes there, lol.","987":"haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it","988":"Yeah, we've invented so many different pots and pans and plates for cooking. I have bought so many cause I want to cook so many different foods","989":"So it all begins with an egg being fertilized and being implanted into the uterus is that correct?","990":"It's hard to believe it was released in 2013. that feels so long ago.","991":"Wow, Bruce crossed the line first. ","992":"Absolutely crazy mix they had going in that show, a ton of episodes just between those three. Pokemon is another show that had quite a lot of episodes. ","993":"Yeah. NEP win the last super bowl.","994":"Absolutely I couldn't agree more. I cant believe ballet dancers can go through 3 pairs of tips a week .","995":"Well know my curiousity is really peaked. I would like to know how facebook came about. Wasn't there another site like it before it came out.","996":"It's interesting how much we rely on cars. It seems before 1908 that cars were not really available to the masses.","997":"You could be right on that one. The first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana LOL!","998":"I can believe it. Bowling was popular in the 60s, I loved the movie Kingpin","999":"No, that's crazy! Was it made for a specific purpose or occasion, or just everyday wear? ","1000":"I wasn't either, but with kids now I have to be lol. ","1001":"That is a lot but compared to its size not that much.  I guess places like Siberia are sparely populated.","1002":"If only his punishment was more harsh. He wasn't in prison for long.","1003":"I'm not sure, did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months?","1004":"A bit over two years. This is a fast-moving company, and seniority isn't the only factor in deciding promotions.","1005":"Yes they see and scense motion very differntly im not entierly sure though.","1006":"I use short messages quite a lot. If it's not too complicated I will send a short message, which can save much phone charge.","1007":"I'm kind of annoyed that Doug wasn't nominated for anything. I hear the performance was amazing.","1008":"Wasn't it because he had to pay 40 or so dollars on a late dvd?","1009":"At least they didn't do as bad as the movie Trojan Wars, that movie only made 309 dollars at the box office","1010":"who was the villian in this one? I know it is not the catwoman one.","1011":"I'm not sure but it would be cool! I really like dance too. I just wish I could have seen Tupac dance in his HS play.","1012":"The term interior designer is not that common in the UK. Interior design there is not an official profession.","1013":"Yeah there sure is, I know you notice it when you attend live games but not so much when watching on tv. ","1014":"I'm very sorry to hear that. I think if you want to lose weight, you should not eat too much but you have to eat all kinds of food, vegetables, fruits etc.. And you should also do more exercise.","1015":"haha! i'm actually not sure. do you have a favorite dog?","1016":"Isn't that the truth! So much has changed since the 1900's, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time... which now that I'm thinking about it I think Trump was slightly taller than Hillary.","1017":"I'll be there. You're still a fabulous cook, aren't you?","1018":"I am not sure exactly but I remember it was burned during the Civil War","1019":"Oh no! But I guess Hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end?","1020":"Yah I noticed that review, hopefully they didn't twist the story too much","1021":"I am not sure. \"Moby-Dick\" is my favorite novel. What about you?","1022":"Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.","1023":"Not sure I just like it but the seeds are bitter and must be fermented for flavor","1024":"Oh god, I knew it was bad but when you look at the scope of things it seems hopeless. It's the same thing. People with talent or \"what's valued in society\"are able to climb this ladder to obtain a good life. In reality they are used as a distraction. If you keep the people happy, then you are likely to not encounter as many threats to your own status or power. But look at Greece (or was it rome?) now... not doing too well. ","1025":"i mean are u heared about this","1026":"Yes, two of us.","1027":"Yes, the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering. But for suits and sweaters, you can only take them to the dry cleaners'.","1028":"That makes sense. JFK, Washington, and Jefferson were the 3 wealthiest presidents.","1029":"Let's see, left hand side updated again.  It seems there are more awful scenes to look at.","1030":"Lets talk about google next. The way google maps handles calculating traffic is by seeing how fast Android devices are moving on the road. ","1031":"I loved that Hulk saved Iron Man when he was falling, such a great moment.","1032":"Yes, I guess anyone who makes 8.5 Billion at the box office can refuse to play bad guy roles, if he wants to!","1033":"I remember being very afraid as a small child when visiting the Grand Canyon, so my fear goes back a long time.","1034":"Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes.","1035":"Nice rule I like it actually. The white house is smaller than the guest house","1036":"I doubt they know what one is.  Just curious, do you still have a landline?","1037":"I don't know. I still cannot believe that Myspace didn't buy Facebook when it had the chance.","1038":"she is hot but i like cobie better","1039":"That's right, the third floor.","1040":"You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send. The photograph is all right.","1041":"I understand that. But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction. ","1042":"Is it a dry humor?","1043":"Probably alot more than we know about for sure.  All these games for kids are just practice for future warfare, I think.","1044":"Absolutely. To be frank, I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas. I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days.","1045":"Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.","1046":"How dare you! ( starts to walk off )","1047":"Ah, I confess I never saw that!  I'm such a loser.  LOL","1048":"Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, too?","1049":"He sure has, he is the highest paid celebrity right now, he sure earns a lot of money","1050":"I liked this movie because it is based in 1940 during the fall of France, a lot of people don't pay attention to World War II history outside of when the US got involved in 1941","1051":"I don't think I've gone to a theatre in 18 months.","1052":"I don't blame him. People would definitely look too far into it. Kind of like how the color of the tie you wear matters but the colors \"red\" and \"blue\" for the parties only started in 2000.","1053":"So, the movie is all about romance and music mixed together.But it doesn't look like a happy ender.","1054":"I am. But, I don't think I paid much attention to the music on this one. Too busy trying to keep up with the story line.","1055":"You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore. ","1056":"It's a high fantasy series. I don't know much besides that Similar to Lord of the Rings but different. It takes a lot of creativity and critical analysis to get into something like that.","1057":"Nah, I don't think that's a good idea. We only have a few traveler's checks left. And I only have fifty dollars left in cash.","1058":"It's one of my favorite films too. I don't think anyone thought that an actor would run for president, much less get elected. He was a good actor, and a decent president.","1059":"She's lucky she has her own family to help out. But I don't know what they will do if the adoption is stalled.","1060":"I don't really live close enough to anything now.  I have seen The Importance of Being Ernest in London many years ago, one of Oscar Wilde's.","1061":"It really does.  I haven't had a landline in almost 20 years.  Our last home phone was a standing Mickey Mouse.  I don't even know what happened to it.   I'm tempted to get a home phone just to be different.","1062":"I don't know who is he lol","1063":"Great! Wait here? You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice? ","1064":"Definitely, whatever gets those points on the board.  Kind of like the 105 points Cheryl Miller once scored in a game.  That's crazy, sometimes teams dont even score that many.","1065":"I'm a blood donor myself.  I don't think there are that many for humans.  Do you give blood?","1066":"Yeah, I was wondering about that as well. Even the most revered\n moved don't do that. ","1067":"Slot machines? No, I don't want that! That's too boring. I want a game with cards or dice.","1068":"Well... I actually don't even know how to respond to that, but I totally need to google this afterwards.  My thing is, okay, the White House is really big, right?  Well if the guest house is larger, then it must be yuge!","1069":"The casts for this movie don't seem bad","1070":"That is so strange. I really don't associate action with drama. It seems like more of a still emotion to me.","1071":"Actually she removed it from Spotify because she does not believe it should be free but kept it in Pandora","1072":"I don't know.  What was he called?","1073":"no, I don't have this information","1074":"I don't know. If you were a desert creature a lot of water would suck. HAHA","1075":"8.6\/10","1076":"What about this one? This one's got a label.","1077":"very true","1078":"It lets him fly, shoot out lasers and pretty much makes him do anything. It makes him pretty strong as well! It is pretty cool. ","1079":"That's interesting.  Impressive that Alex Smith received a bachelor's degree in 2 years since he had taken so many AP tests in high school.","1080":"Well. you can call Berne Li. He is the head of the advertising department of the paper.","1081":"Some people might find it interesting, there is a sound frequency that creates fear in us ","1082":"Did you know he was discovered by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest?","1083":"It is a space ranger doll called Buzz Lightyear.","1084":"There are a lot of fight scenes that are back to back too, which makes the film feel really fast-paced. Like there's a scene where John fights his way to the guy that stole his care who's in a nightclub and escapes, and shortly after, John is back in his hotel room and has to fight off an assassination attempt.","1085":"Never heard of that one. Any idea where they were started?","1086":"That's a shame Ted Kennedy blocked, I think it's an important story that needs to be told and Kate Mara did a good job playing Kopechne","1087":"Be warned, sir.

Loosely inspired by Charles Perrault's original fairy tale and Walt Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty, the film portrays the story from the perspective of the eponymous antagonist, depicting her conflicted relationship with the princess and king of a corrupt kingdom.[4]\n\nWalt Disney Pictures announced the film's development in 2010, with Joe Roth as producer and Jolie, Don Hahn, and Michael Vieira as executive producers. Principal photography took place between June and October 2012. The film special screening took place in London on May 9, 2014, at Kensington Palace.[5] Maleficent premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on May 28, 2014, and was released in the United Kingdom that same day. The film was released in the United States on May 30, 2014 in the Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats, as well as in conventional theaters. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, having grossed over $758 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2014 and the highest-grossing film starring Jolie. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design at the 87th Academy Awards.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1\tPlot\n2\tCast\n3\tProduction\n3.1\tWriting\n3.2\tFilming\n3.3\tRe-shoots\n3.4\tVisual effects\n4\tMusic\n4.1\tTrack listing\n5\tRelease\n5.1\tMarketing\n5.2\tNovel\n5.3\tHome media\n6\tReception\n6.1\tBox office\n6.1.1\tCommercial analysis\n6.2\tCritical response\n6.3\tAccolades\n7\tThemes\n8\tSequel\n9\tReferences\n10\tExternal links\nPlot[edit]\nMaleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a young girl, she meets and falls in love with a human peasant boy named Stefan, whose love for Maleficent is overshadowed by his ambition. As they become older, the two grow apart, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors. When King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him and forces him to retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter, Princess Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors. He drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Instead, he cuts off her wings with iron, which is lethal to fairies, and presents them to the king. Devastated by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdom. She finds a raven named Diaval to act as her wings, spy and confidant. She transforms him into different forms as needed, including human.\n\nAfter some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that Stefan, now king, is hosting a christening for his newborn daughter, Aurora. Bent on revenge, Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess: on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep from which she will never awaken. When Stefan begs for mercy, Maleficent mocks him and offers an antidote: the curse can be only broken by true love's kiss. Fearing for his daughter's safety, Stefan sends Aurora to live with three pixies\u2014Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle\u2014until the day after her sixteenth birthday, while he destroys all the spinning wheels in the kingdom and hides their remnants in the castle dungeon. He sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. King Stefan slips into madness and paranoia, trying to prevent the curse, even neglecting to see his wife on her deathbed.\n\nDespite her initial dislike for Aurora, Maleficent begins to care for her when the bumbling and neglectful pixies fail to do so. After a brief meeting with the young Aurora, Maleficent watches over her from afar. When Aurora is fifteen, she encounters Maleficent. Knowing that she is being watched over, she calls Maleficent her \"fairy godmother.\" Maleficent tries desperately to undo the curse but is unsuccessful, as the curse proves to be unbreakable by any means other than true love's kiss. In the forest, Aurora meets Prince Philip, and the two are attracted to each other. On the day before Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live with her in the Moors. When Aurora returns to the cottage, the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her past. Having learned of Maleficent's true identity, Aurora runs to her father's castle.\n\nAfter a brief reunion with his daughter, Stefan locks her away in a room for her own safety while setting up a plan to kill Maleficent. However, the power of the curse draws Aurora to the dungeon, where a spinning wheel magically reassembles itself. She pricks her finger and falls into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse. Maleficent, intent on saving Aurora, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefan's castle, but Phillip's kiss fails to awaken Aurora. At her bedside, Maleficent apologizes to Aurora and kisses her forehead. Aurora awakens, as Maleficent's motherly feelings towards her count as true love. However, as Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, they are ambushed by Stefan and his guards, with an iron net dropping on her. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, and he battles Stefan's guards, but he is eventually caught as well. Stefan taunts Maleficent, who is dizzy and sick from the iron, his former love for her fully gone, but before he can deliver a killing blow, Aurora finds her wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves. Maleficent carries Stefan to the top of the castle's highest tower and beats him easily and quickly in battle, but cannot bring herself to kill him. Stefan attacks her as she turns away, however, and both plummet from the tower. Maleficent breaks away and sends Stefan to his death.\n\nIn the end, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and Aurora is crowned queen to unify the two kingdoms.\n\nCast[edit]\n\n\n\nAngelina Jolie (left), Sharlto Copley (center) and Sam Riley (right)\nAngelina Jolie as Maleficent\nIsobelle Molloy as Young Maleficent\nElla Purnell as Teen Maleficent\nSharlto Copley as Stefan[6]\nMichael Higgins as Young Stefan\nJackson Bews as Teen Stefan\nElle Fanning as Aurora\nVivienne Jolie-Pitt as Little Aurora\nEleanor Worthington Cox as Pre-teen Aurora\nJanet McTeer as Elderly Aurora\/Narrator\nSam Riley as Diaval[6]\nImelda Staunton as Knotgrass[6]\nJuno Temple as Thistlewit[7]\nLesley Manville as Flittle[6]\nBrenton Thwaites as Prince Philip[8]\nKenneth Cranham as King Henry[6][9]\nHannah New as Princess Leila\nProduction[edit]\nAngelina Jolie had long been attached to the project since March 2010, when Tim Burton, who had tentatively planned to direct, chose not to pursue it.[10][11] Jolie's desire to play this role stemmed from her love of the character when she was a little girl.[12] Linda Woolverton was commissioned to write the script for the film.[13] On January 6, 2012, Disney announced that Robert Stromberg, the production designer of Alice in Wonderland and Oz the Great and Powerful, would direct the film.[14] Joe Roth, Don Hahn, and Richard D. Zanuck were hired as producers, although Zanuck died later that year.[15] Roth said the film would not have been made if Jolie had not agreed to take the title role: \"She seemed like the only person who could play the part. There was no point in making the movie if it wasn't her.\"[16]\n\nIn March 2012, Elle Fanning was reported to be in talks for the role of Princess Aurora, the Sleeping Beauty.[17][18] Her casting was officially announced in May 2012, along with Sharlto Copley as the male lead, King Stefan, Princess Aurora's father, then described as the half-human, half-fairy son of a human king, along with Imelda Staunton; Miranda Richardson as Queen Ulla, then described as a fairy queen who is Maleficent's aunt with a dislike of her niece; Kenneth Cranham as a king; Sam Riley as Diaval, a raven who changes into human form and is Maleficent's right hand; and Lesley Manville.[6]\n\nDirector Stromberg highlighted the \"wonderful\" contrast between the two lead actresses, Elle Fanning and Angelina Jolie, calling the character of Aurora the \"beacon of light\" that he was looking forward to blending with the darkness of Maleficent.[19]\n\nWriting[edit]\n\"I was really moved by the script from first reading. It was like uncovering a great mystery. We all know the story of Sleeping Beauty and we all know Maleficent and what happened at the christening because we've all grown up with that. But what we've never known is, what happened before?\"\n\u2014Angelina Jolie[20]\n\nLinda Woolverton's screenplay went through at least 15 versions as the film progressed in the production.[21] Director Robert Stromberg said: \"I met many times with Linda Woolverton, the writer. We did lots of roundtable discussions and sort of cut out the fat as much as we could and sort of purified the storyline as much as we could\".[22] In some earlier versions of the story, Stefan was the half-human, half-fairy bastard son of King Henry. The version of the screenplay which went into shooting originally included two characters called Queen Ulla and King Kinloch, the fairy queen and the fairy king of the Moors, and the aunt and uncle of Maleficent.[6] Miranda Richardson and Peter Capaldi were cast and shot the Queen Ulla and King Kinloch scenes, but their roles were cut in the editing process together with more than 15 minutes of the first act of the film. Stromberg said: \"We spent a bit more time originally in the fairy world before we got into the human side of things ... we wanted to get it [the film] under two hours. So we cut about fifteen minutes out of the first act, and then that had to be seamed together with some pretty basic reshoots.\"[23]\n\nStromberg later claimed in an interview that he employed an \"age-old\" emotional storytelling for the film and called it \"the biggest thrill\" against all technology advances.[19] \"And the way we play with that is we have somebody who's perhaps in love but betrayed and doesn't believe that true love exists. So the moral to it is we can all feel dark ourselves but not to lose hope because there is light in places where we might not be expecting\", he explained.[19]\n\nFilming[edit]\nPrincipal photography began on June 13, 2012.[24] Some filming took place in the Buckinghamshire countryside.[25]\n\nRe-shoots[edit]\nJohn Lee Hancock assisted Stromberg with re-shoots for the film. Hancock, who had just finished overseeing the final post-production stages of Saving Mr. Banks, was approached by producer Joe Roth, with whom he had worked on Snow White and the Huntsman. Roth said: \"He's not directing. He wrote pages, and I hired a first-time director, and it's good to have him on set.\" Roth was asked why a \"film of this magnitude was entrusted to a novice director\", and he noted that Stromberg won Academy Awards for production design on Avatar and Alice in Wonderland. Roth said: \"The movie is gorgeous to look at, and the last 75 minutes are really entertaining. The issue was the opening, which was re-shot over eight days.\"[26]\n\nVisual effects[edit]\nAs a previous production designer, Stromberg sought to balance the use of practical and computer-generated effects. For example, while Maleficent's horns and facial prosthetics were created by makeup artist Rick Baker, Digital Domain took facial capture of Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, and Juno Temple for the three pixies to be generated with high authenticity with the help of special rigging by Disney Research in Zurich.[19] For the visuals, Stromberg wanted to make it \"a bit more grounded\" and \"not too surreal\" because it could be distracting from the simplicity of the story.[19] He also regretted not employing bigger sets and allowing actors to work in a more tangible environment, on \"real sets with real lights\".[19]\n\nMusic[edit]\nJames Newton Howard was hired to score the film in October 2012.[27] On January 23, 2014, it was announced that recording artist Lana Del Rey would be covering the song \"Once Upon a Dream\", from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty as the title song for Maleficent. The song \"Once Upon a Dream\" is based on the Grand Waltz from ballet \"Sleeping Beauty\" written by Russian composer Tchaikovsky. [28][29]\n\nDel Rey was handpicked by Angelina Jolie to perform the song.[30] The single was released on January 26 and was made available for free for a limited time through Google Play.[31][32]\n\nMaleficent (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\nFilm score by James Newton Howard\nReleased\tMay 27, 2014\nStudio\tAbbey Road Studios\nGenre\tOrchestral\nLength\t1:11:46\nLabel\tWalt Disney\nTrack listing[edit]\nAll music composed by James Newton Howard (Tracks 1\u201322).\n\nMaleficent (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\tPerformer(s)\tLength\n1.\t\"Maleficent Suite\"\t \t \t6:38\n2.\t\"Welcome to the Moors\"\t \t \t1:05\n3.\t\"Maleficent Flies\"\t \t \t4:39\n4.\t\"Battle of the Moors\"\t \t \t4:58\n5.\t\"Three Peasant Women\"\t \t \t1:04\n6.\t\"Go Away\"\t \t \t2:26\n7.\t\"Aurora and the Fawn\"\t \t \t2:28\n8.\t\"The Christening\"\t \t \t5:30\n9.\t\"Prince Philip\"\t \t \t2:29\n10.\t\"The Spindle's Power\"\t \t \t4:35\n11.\t\"You Could Live Here Now\"\t \t \t2:26\n12.\t\"Path of Destruction\"\t \t \t1:47\n13.\t\"Aurora in Faerieland\"\t \t \t4:41\n14.\t\"The Wall Defends Itself\"\t \t \t1:06\n15.\t\"The Curse Won't Reverse\"\t \t \t1:21\n16.\t\"Are You Maleficent?\"\t \t \t2:10\n17.\t\"The Army Dances\"\t \t \t1:28\n18.\t\"Phillip's Kiss\"\t \t \t2:20\n19.\t\"The Iron Gauntlet\"\t \t \t1:35\n20.\t\"True Love's Kiss\"\t \t \t2:33\n21.\t\"Maleficent Is Captured\"\t \t \t7:42\n22.\t\"The Queen of Faerieland\"\t \t \t3:25\n23.\t\"Once Upon a Dream\"\tJack Lawrence, Sammy Fain\tLana Del Rey\t3:20\nTotal length:\t1:11:46\nRelease[edit]\nThe film was originally slated for a March 2014 release, before it was changed to July 2, 2014. On September 18, 2013, the film's release date was bumped up from July 2, 2014 to May 30, due to Pixar's The Good Dinosaur having production problems and delays.[33] In the United Kingdom, the film was released on May 28.[34]\n\nMarketing[edit]\nOn August 10, 2013, as part of the live action motion picture panel of the 2013 Disney D23 Expo in the Anaheim Convention Center at Anaheim, California, Disney unveiled its first look of Maleficent by revealing the new logo of the film's title and one-minute clip from the film. Angelina Jolie made a surprise visit to the expo and talked with the attendees about her fascination with Disney's Sleeping Beauty as a child, her working experience with the filmmakers on the film, and her love of Disney. She also remarked on how she scared little girls when she was in costume, makeup, and acting during shooting; this led to the decision of hiring her own daughter, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, for the role of the young Princess Aurora, since she would not be scared of her own mother during principal photography.[35]\n\nWalt Disney Pictures released the teaser poster for Maleficent on November 12, 2013, featuring Jolie in costume and makeup, akin to the character's depiction in the original film.[36][37] The first trailer was released the following day, on November 13. The first teaser trailer was attached to Thor: The Dark World, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Frozen, and Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters.[38] Two more trailers were released in January 2014, revealing Maleficent's appearance. A third trailer featured Lana Del Rey singing \"Once Upon a Dream\".[39] The final trailer was released on March 18, 2014.[40]\n\nStarting April 18, 2014, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney California Adventure previewed the film inside the ABC Sound Studio and It's Tough to Be a Bug! theaters, respectively.[41] Disney Infinity 2.0 featured Maleficent as a playable figure utilizing the look from the movie.\n\nNovel[edit]\nA tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 2014, written by Elizabeth Rudnick. The novel elaborates on the movie, utilizing a brief prologue detailing Maleficent's birth, early childhood and parentage. The movie never fully elaborates on how the intense hatred amongst men and fairfolk during King Henry's reign came to be, a void the novel fills. The novel also features some different versions of key moments in the film, for example, Stefan angrily smothers King Henry on his deathbed after he declares that he's still unfit to rule even after having brought Maleficent's severed wings to him. Later, Stefan forges a Royal Proclamation declaring himself as the late monarch's chosen successor. Maleficent's encounter with the infant Princess Aurora in the forest also differs from the one in the film, since Aurora does feel afraid of Maleficent after she frightens her away. Some of these ideas had originally been filmed but were either cut or altered during post-production while others may have been dramatic license on the part of the author.[citation needed]\n\nHome media[edit]\nMaleficent was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and digital download on November 4, 2014.[42] The film topped the home video sales chart in its first week of release.[43] As of February 2015, Maleficent has made over $74 million in total home video sales.[44]\n\nReception[edit]\nBox office[edit]\nMaleficent earned a gross of $241.4 million in the USA & Canada, and $517.1 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $758.5 million against a budget of $180 million.[3] Calculating in all expenses, Deadline.com estimated that the film made a profit of $190.77 million.[45] Worldwide, in its opening weekend, the film earned $175.5 million,[46][47] $9 million of which was from IMAX locations.[48] It is also the biggest debut among films starring Angelina Jolie,[48] and the actress' highest-grossing film of all time worldwide,[49][50] as well as the fourth-highest-grossing 2014 film (behind Transformers: Age of Extinction, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and Guardians of the Galaxy), and the 15th Disney-distributed film to surpass the $700 million mark at the worldwide box office.[51] The film is also one of four Walt Disney Studios releases in 2014 to gross over $500 million; the other titles being Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Big Hero 6.[52]\n\nIn North America, Maleficent earned $4.2 million in Thursday night showings, surpassing the midnight or late-night grosses of previous live-action fantasy films, Alice in Wonderland, Oz the Great and Powerful[53][54] and Snow White and the Huntsman. By the end of its opening day (including late-night Thursday earnings), the film earned $24.3 million, similar to Oz, but ahead of Snow White and the Huntsman and behind Alice.[55] Maleficent finished its debut weekend at first place with $69.4 million[46] ($6.7 million of which was earned from IMAX locations and 35% of which was earned from 3D showings),[56][57] which exceeded Disney's expectations of a $60 million opening[58] and making it the largest opening-weekend performance for a live-action film starring Jolie (a record previously held by her 2008 film Wanted),[56] as well as the third-highest opening weekend for a solo female star (behind the first two films in The Hunger Games series).[59] Disney reported that 46% of ticket buyers in Thursday previews were male,[53] while weekend reports said family audiences accounted for 45% of the film's total audience, and couples and teens accounted for 38% and 18% respectively.[56][58] Female audiences and moviegoers over 25 years old held respective proportions of 60% and 51%.[56] Dave Hollis, head of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, attributed this success to \"some momentum and great word-of-mouth.\"[58] During its first week, the film earned a total of $93.8 million, ahead of Snow White yet behind Oz and Alice.[60] In its second weekend, Maleficent dropped by 50.6% to $34.3 million, finishing in second place.[46] It experienced a smaller second-weekend drop than Snow White,[61][62] yet still bigger than Oz and Alice.[63] In North America, Maleficent is the eighth-highest-grossing 2014 film.[64]\n\nMaleficent opened outside North America on the same weekend as North America, earning $20.1 million from 35 territories in its first two days (May 28\u201329, 2014).[65] During its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $106.1 million from 47 territories.[47] Its largest opening weekends were in China ($22.2 million),[66] Mexico ($14.0 million) and Russia and the CIS ($13.0 million).[48] On the second weekend of release, Maleficent fell to $61.7 million, earning from 52 markets.[67][68] It was in first place at the box office outside North America on three weekends, its first, third ($39.2 million)[69][70] and fourth ($47.9 million).[71]\n\nMaleficent is the fourth-highest-grossing 2014 film,[72] and Angelina Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film.[49] In total earnings, the film's top markets after North America are Japan ($57.6 million), China ($47.7 million), Mexico ($46.2 million), Russia ($37.7 million), Brazil ($33.2 million), the United Kingdom ($31.7 million), Venezuela ($24.5 million) and Italy ($19.1 million).[73] It was also the most watched film at the Maltese box office in 2014, enjoying an eighteen-week run.[74]\n\nCommercial analysis[edit]\nDave Lewis, writing for HitFix, predicted that although Disney fairy tales and Angelina Jolie's performance might attract audiences, Maleficent would not gross even as much as Oz the Great and Powerful, explaining that the film was released on the same time frame with competitive releases like X-Men: Days of Future Past, Godzilla and A Million Ways to Die in the West,[75] even though it outperformed those films later on. Boxoffice wrote that Maleficent had a successful marketing campaign, featured Jolie in the title role, and its \"female-driven\" themes and plot aimed at women. However, the site also noted that the film would have to compete with other summer releases, and the character of Maleficent may not attract young children.[76] Todd Cunningham of The Wrap shared the same opinion, writing that \"[the film's] connecting with parents and that Jolie's considerable star power is having a big impact.\"[77][78] Wells Fargo's Marci Ryvicker predicted that Maleficent might be \"too dark and scary to be profitable\" and was likely to force Disney \"into a write-down\", as reported by The New York Times; while RBC Capital Markets' David Bank commented that \"It's definitely in the 'not a sure thing' bucket.\"[79][80][81] Wall St. Cheat Sheet explained that the film approached to a more \"grown-up\" and \"sinister\" aspect of the classic, and targeted for an older audience like young adults. \"It's just too scary for younger children,\" the site wrote.[82] ScreenRant added that the PG rating of the film would \"fill a void in the marketplace, which is currently without a traditional \"family friendly\" option.\"[83] Box Office Mojo primarily compared the film with 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman (another film that also focused on a fairy tale villain), predicting that Maleficent \"has a good chance\" of matching Snow White's gross in North America box office.[84] The film however, ended up grossing double the amount projected.\n\nVariety wrote that the film's opening weekend outperforming initial box-office projections was later attributed by analysts in part to Disney's successful marketing to the \"potent demographic\" (female audiences) much like the studio accomplished with Frozen, in which both films feature a strong female lead.[85] Disney argued that a lack of family-friendly options in the marketplace would \"bode well for Maleficent's [box office] performance\" in its two first weeks of release.[85]\n\nThe cost of the film was offset by a rebate from the UK in the amount of \u00a323,535,108 ($37 million in 2012, the period in which it was shot).[86]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nMaleficent received mixed reviews from critics. The film holds a 51% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 211 reviews, with an average score of 5.7\/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Angelina Jolie's magnetic performance outshines Maleficent's dazzling special effects; unfortunately, the movie around them fails to justify all that impressive effort.\"[87] On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 56 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A\" grade on a scale of A+ to F.[89][90] Angelina Jolie's performance in the film has been repeatedly singled out for praise by critics.\n\nThe New York Times stated, with two shorn wings and an astonishing maternal kiss, \"Maleficent\" demolishes stereotypes that were only tweaked in \"Frozen\". [91] Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail was very positive about the film, writing that \"[it] surprises not for its baroque visions of a colourful woodland enlivened by joyous fairies and a forbidding castle peopled by unhappy humans, but rather for the thematic richness of its story gloriously personified by Angelina Jolie in the title role.\" While criticizing the overuse of CGI and 3D effects, she particularly praised the positive message of the film and Jolie's performance. She concluded her review with \"Long live the feminist revisionist backstory.\"[92] On the contrary, Keith Staskiewicz, writing for the Entertainment Weekly, awarded the film a \"B-\" and wrote that \"there's a lot of levitating cliffs and odd flora. But despite their bleeding-edge digital design, the backgrounds have all the depth of the old matte-painted backgrounds of the analog days,\" which made the film \"[feel] classical in nature.\" He further commented that \"The characters are boiled down to their essentials, the humor is timelessly broad.\"[93] Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars, commenting that the recent \"formula\" that \"a new angle on a well-known fairy tale appears in the light\" \"works\" with Maleficent. He also said that the film \"is all about second thoughts\", as Maleficent \"spends much of the film as Aurora's conflicted fairy godmother.\" Phillips particularly praised Jolie and Elle Fanning's acting, Rick Baker's makeup (for Jolie's \"angular, serrated look\"), but criticized James Newton Howard's \"sloshy, pushy\" musical score.[94] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \"This Disney reimagining of Sleeping Beauty lacks true enchantment, but Angelina Jolie saves the day.\"[95] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, writing \"This is Jolie's film because of the Maleficent she makes. Everyone else, even Aurora, fades in her presence.\"[96] J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III of PopMatters wrote, \"Even at its silliest, Maleficent is a well-acted film, with Sharlto Copley turning in a memorable performance and Elle Fanning proving to be an inspired choice for Aurora\/Sleeping Beauty. Jolie manages to steal her own show in most every scene. Jolie is excellent as the hopeful fairy, enjoying the world she flies through. She is also brilliant as the Dark Lady, who could be a perfect counterpart to any Darth Vader, as she malevolently takes her revenge on those who have wronged her.\"[97]\n\nAnn Hornaday of The Washington Post awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that \"Still, for all its limitations, \"Maleficent\" manages to be improbably entertaining to watch, due solely to its title character.\"[98] Writing for Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded Maleficent three out of four stars, praising the themes of the film and the acting of Jolie. Seitz also called the scene in which Maleficent discovers the loss of her wings \"the most traumatizing image I've seen in a Hollywood fairy tale since the Christ-like sacrifice of Aslan in 2005's The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\"[99] The review in The Globe and Mail further explained that \"in the simple context of a fairy tale, Jolie does make both the terrifying horned creature and her gradual awakening heartfelt,\" extolling the \"emotional richness\" behind her physical acts.[92] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times felt more negatively, assigning it a D. Although Roeper praised the visuals, he criticized the acting and writing, stating that \"the story itself might well put you into the same type of coma that befalls the heroine.\"[100] However, some such as Stella Morabito of The Federalist, criticized the film for its negative portrayal of men. According to Morabito, \"Maleficent lacks a single complex male character\". Morabito also criticized the film for portraying Maleficent as a hero.[101]\n\nMary Costa, who voiced Aurora in the 1959 animated motion picture, called the film, \"a very good movie\". She added that \u201cthe concept and perspective are totally different than the original film\u2019s, which makes it new and interesting.\" As for Jolie's performance, she said \"No one could have played the part of Maleficent better,\" concluding that \"she was absolutely magnificent!\u201d[102]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nList of awards and nominations\nAward \/ Film Festival\tCategory\tRecipient(s)\tResult\n87th Academy Awards[103]\tBest Costume Design\tAnna B.

Hayley Krischner of The Huffington Post interpreted the scene as an important reference to rape culture: \"This is the horrific side of rape culture. We're so enmeshed in it that it's impossible to ignore a metaphoric rape that occurs in a Disney movie\". She went on to praise the film for giving a positive and hopeful message to rape victims, ultimately allowing \"the woman to recover. It gives her agency. It gives her power. It allows her to reclaim the story\".[113] Monika Bartyzel of The Week noted the scene's implications in her review: \"In its first act, Maleficent offers a dark, surprisingly adult exploration of rape and female mutilation\". However, Bartyzel went on to opine that the film portrayed Maleficent's actions as \"a rape revenge fantasy\" and criticized the film for not following through on its early subtext, ultimately calling it less feminist and reductive compared to its 1959 counterpart: \"In Maleficent, Aurora is the product of a cold and loveless marriage and a vengeful, unhinged rapist. Her safety relies on a trio of clueless and dangerously careless fairies, and her Godmother is the woman who cursed her \u2014 and who had, in turn, been violated by her own father\".[114] Angelina Jolie addressed the issue during an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the Woman's Hour programme and claimed that the subtext was intentional: \"The question was asked: 'What could make a woman become so dark and lose all sense of her maternity, her womanhood, and her softness?' [...] We were very conscious, the writer and I, that [the scene] was a metaphor for rape\". She further explained that the answer to the question \"What could bring her back?\" was still \"an extreme Disney, fun version [of the story]\", but \"at the core it is abuse, and how the abused then have a choice of abusing others or overcoming and remaining loving, open people\".[115][116]\n\nJordan Shapiro of Forbes argued that the film's main subtext was the detrimental effects of ultimatums between capitalist and socialist societies. He pointed out that the Moors represented a socialist, nature-oriented, democratic society while the human kingdom was one of capitalism, industry and absolute monarchy. Shapiro further commented that the character of Stefan, his theft of the Moors' riches (the jewel) and his mutilation of Maleficent's wings for the sake of his ambition were references to the American Dream. He conceived the wing-tearing scene as \"a social commentary that any hierarchical rise to power inherently happens through the exploitation of others\", explaining that it was the reason why \"without her wings, Maleficent also becomes an oppressive ruler of the Moors. Everything she represents, believes and stands for has been grounded\", and \"like most victims of oppression\", \"she takes it out on those who are smaller and weaker\". He concluded that through the merge of the two kingdoms at the end of the film, it sought to weave together capitalism and socialism and let go oppositions: \"It is time to leave the kingdom of familiar partisan oppositions: let's replace either\/or with neither\/nor or both\/and\".[117]\n\nSequel[edit]\nOn June 3, 2014, Angelina Jolie hinted about the possibility of a sequel.[118] On June 15, 2015, Disney announced the sequel with Linda Woolverton returning to write the screenplay and Joe Roth to produce the film.[119] On April 26, 2016, it was confirmed that Jolie would reprise her role as Maleficent.[120] On August 30, 2017, Disney hired screenwriter Jez Butterworth to re-write the initial script by Woolverton.[121] On October 3, 2017, it was reported that Joachim R\u00f8nning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales) is in talks on directing the sequel.[122] In January 2018, it was reported that the sequel would start filming in April 2018.[123]\n\nReferences[edit]\nJump up ^ \"Maleficent (PG)\".

Don't really enjoy hockey quite as much, maybe the only entertaining one was when Canada scored 132 goals in one game in 1924.","1347":"I think its cute Mikey and him sulley were trying to fix the door","1348":"The goverment has also shut down 17 times  in the past 37 years, this year was terrible though, nice chat!","1349":"The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us. I wonder if Your pastry tastes better.","1350":"Well yes, but that's not all because  in the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color","1351":"Not only humans and mammals give birth.","1352":"Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance, so their employees cannot collect benefits.","1353":"That seems incredibly sexist. Of course not many women are elected to office even in this day and age so it isn't super surprising. ","1354":"Yes I agree with you. Although not all of them are good haha, like the Jupiter radio or the classical Latin haha. Do you ever watch television by the way?","1355":"No it can't be, and not all teams have roofs on their ballparks and all the different climates and all, tough work. ","1356":"Not all jokes are funny though, that's for sure.","1357":"True! I used to have some Yorkies...they would have given millimeters!

I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918!","1359":"It's nice to see though isn't it? Not all governments are only focused on their own country. On the other hand, the U.S. government owns 86% of the land in Nevada, sort of shows where our priorities are.","1360":"I hate to disappoint you, but unlike what most people think, we aren't all exactly the same!","1361":"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all.

Too bad not all concerts are awesome like this. I mean Creed was sued for bad performance","1370":"I'm sure it will be all fight.","1371":"For sure, would be difficult. All we think about are the good players, not all the role players involved. What do you think of Antonio Brown to the Raiders? I'm excited, the Steelers are great though too.","1372":"I guess they wanted to become independent from Denmark? Denmark is a pretty short country, so I guess that's why they lost. In the UK, not all men had the vote until 1918. I wonder what determined who got the vote.","1373":"Yeah but that just goes to show that not all remakes are as good as the original!","1374":"I wasn't all that impressed by the food.","1375":"You see, that means when anything is up for renewal, we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out.

Where can I find the books for my geography course?","1380":"Thank you very much for singing to me, it truly makes me feel much better.","1381":"Huh, thanks for sharing that interesting fact. There sure are some eclectic items on display. I really liked seeing the gem collection.","1382":"when do you plan on studying for those exams?","1383":"Nerdiest looking team ","1384":"Why do you say that? ","1385":"Well it was aluminum and only weighed about 356 pounds!!","1386":"Oh really? What did you have? I know that they make sedans, coupes, convertibles, SUVs, etc.","1387":"Yeah, apparently he thought the raccoon might be rabid but still does not explain getting students involved.","1388":"It isn't in the musical genre so I don't know if there is much music, but interestingly, even though Keira Knightley does not play Turing's initial love interest, she and Turing end up getting married because Turing keeps his homosexuality a secret. ","1389":"Thank you very much. May I leave my baggage here until Thursday?","1390":"Major Larry was such a jerk.","1391":"I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.

","1399":"The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us. I wonder if your pastry tastes better...","1400":"Well, I agree. A dietary vegan not only doesn't eat meat, but they don't eat eggs, any dairy or anything derived from an animal. That takes away all tasteful things!","1401":"Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, but also he inspired the whole team.","1402":"Yes, I know, right?  Not only that but every US president with a beard has been a Republican.","1403":"Yes Not only was he really smart, he had a PhD in astrophysics and also could play the guitar by using coins for guitar picks","1404":"Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!","1405":"That makes sense, I think it would surprise people because they don't generally think about how short most careers of football players are. Plus not all players are on the level of Brady there are far more players like Kellan Moore who most people haven't really heard of and who probably get paid a lot less. ","1406":"haha, Ther are amazing animals! No wonder society has given them the sobriquet \"mans best friend\" not only can they take the subway but they aid disabled people, assist police imagine the dog that has to sniff drugs all day... cocaine especially i wonder if it has the same effects on humans and maybe thats why the dog is now able to help the military, hunt, herd animals, pull roads, they are even therapeutic... shall i keep going, dogs are awesome!","1407":"Not only the eyes, Such movements primarily involve the tail, the ears and so on","1408":"Not all snakes are venomous.","1409":" I bet they regret not pulling it, and yea of course I like to travel that seems like a really convenient bus to take, not only do you travel fast but you get to see a beautiful landscape","1410":"Not only can it appease one's thirst, but it can also refresh one when tired.","1411":"I think if you're cold, then the animal is cold and probably needs clothing. Not all dogs are built for cold weather. I like the program that Istanbul has created for dogs.","1412":"Not only that, but Baz Lurhmann's direction was a magnificent sight to behold","1413":"Not only that but Chris Pine was great in the movie","1414":"It is possible, not only do sound frequency produce fear but most humans have an innate fear of snakes and spiders","1415":"Not only do they smile, but they smile MORE when they hit the beat, How cool is that? I had no idea that ballet dancers can go through up to four pairs of pointe shoes in a week. That sounds like it would be really hard on your feet!","1416":"Not only are there hybrid electric cars, they actually have trucks and buses too!","1417":"Not only humans and mammals give birth.","1418":"Not only that but the Australians have also appeared in 63% of all finals and have won 71% of their final appearances.\n","1419":"yup and not only wre the lead programmer sometimes the same as the game designers, the other video gram programmed just flat out doubled as the entire design team. thats a whole bunch of jobs! but now games need entire dedicated teams for each function. im glad video games are stepping up in every way every year","1420":"Absolutely! Not only was it banned, but it was for over a decade!","1421":"It is amazing how much he was able to determine without all of the technology that we have today. Not only was he able to determine that gravity existed but he developed many mathematical equations that we still use today. ","1422":"True.  But Trump showed a net worth of over $10 billion on the financial statement.  Not only is the White House smaller than his place at Trump Tower, the residential part is smaller than the guest house of the President.","1423":"Not all all. As long as your a good person welcome here","1424":"Not only was it given a high rating by Rotten Tomatoes, but many friends of mine also personally vouched for the movie.","1425":"Wonder what that does. Did you know that Apple had its own clothing line in 1986.","1426":"don't rem seeing him in it though.","1427":"Its more aesthetic performance as in art","1428":"Yeah I know there are rules now.  I like Ethan Happ from the badgers this season, decided to stay his full time at school, and now he's one of the best players in college and is helping his team immensely.

Whatever they are called, they are delicious!","1440":"Would you like to ask any questions about it?","1441":"He seems pretty accomplished.
