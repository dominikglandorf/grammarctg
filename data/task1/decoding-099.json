Not everyone would agree, but I think it's the most iconic phrase in the English language.\""],"546":["Would you say that DC movies are better than Marvel movies?"],"547":["Don't like the idea of superheroes fighting each other, would you?"],"548":["I not entirely enjoy Marvel, but I think DC has some remarkable films, such as the best movie in Hollywood."],"549":["\"The final battle was without a doubt one of the most intense superhero showdowns I've ever seen!\""],"550":["\"Well, not my best friend does not like Marvel, in fact, he is a huge Marvel fan, but I think DC has its best movies too, like the Dark Knight, it's my favorite!\""],"551":["That is quite the most exciting way to spend your free time! Wouldn't you like to see Wonder Woman join the battle?"],"552":["I was a massive NWA fan, my best friend, and I still think they're one of the most iconic groups in hip-hop history."],"553":["I find that very likely. What would probably happen if the most critical rappers in the world were to engage in a compliment battle, would be a truly remarkable display of lyrical mastery, with the most skilled MCs delivering the most extraordinary compliments, and the crowd going wild with applause."],"554":["But not all my best friends would like to watch a rap battle where everyone complements each other. Would you like to try to imagine a world where rappers show respect and kindness?"],"555":["\"My best friend is actually a huge fan of this unique rap battle, she loves how the opponents show respect for each other, it's a refreshing change from the usual trash talking in other battles.\""],"556":["\"Well, even though I don't think NWA would have fit in with this respectful rap battle, I can imagine my best friend, Ice T, being a part of it. He's always been one of the most talented rappers, and I'm sure he would have done an amazing job to impress the crowd.\""],"557":["\"This is not going back to the good old days when I didn't just disrespectfully go to the fullest extent of calling out my opponents. Even though Eminem had done it well, I didn't think anyone else could do it better.\""],"558":["That's some of the best science I've ever heard, but I think it's even more fascinating that this phenomenon is most pronounced in the Amazon rainforest, in the Congo Basin, and in the Himalayas."],"559":["Would you not all agree that our body hair loss is a result of some environmental factor?"],"560":["\"Well, I don't think we'd like to believe that, but it's an interesting idea.\""],"561":["If I didn't take the risk, I would stay in my comfort zone and never discover what could have been."],"562":["\"Not all fears could prepare you for this; even if you are not the most prepared person, you'll still have to face your best friend's worst nightmare.\""],"563":["\"I didn't like to play this thought in my best friend's presence, as it might not be the most tasteful conversation topic, but would like to know what you think. Would you like to hear more about the theory?\""],"564":["\"My best friend is a huge bowling fan, and he's always talking about how the top bowlers used to make more money than the top football players.\""],"565":["Can't imagine a league would be so crazy about the colors."],"566":["\"I know that's not the coolest thing about the U of IA, would you like to know what is?\""],"567":["Not only are the colors of the locker rooms surprising, but I find it weird that the university doesn't have a more logical system. Not everyone agrees with me, but I think it's time for a change."],"568":["\"It definitely wasn't very lucrative for them.\""],"569":["\"It's not the highest bowling alley in the world, isn't it?

Every day, I would spend hours on the internet, but I would often forget to take breaks and would end up wasting a lot of time.\""],"575":["\"It's not true, my best friend, that you can't find reliable information on the internet. Would you like to know where? In fact, there are many best websites that provide accurate information. But, unfortunately, they're not easy to find. I had a hard time finding them in the past, but now I'm more careful and selective about the sources I use.\""],"576":["\"The data suggests that the average person spends an astonishing 4-5 hours a day on their phone, which is the most time-consuming activity in human history, surpassing even the most sedentary of jobs, such as being a couch potato.\""],"577":["\"Well, I don't think my best friend would agree with that. She doesn't spend hours on her phone and still manages to have a great social life. In fact, she's the most social person I know!\""],"578":["That's true, and even though the Iphone is the most powerful phone to buy, it doesn't mean we'd like to use it all the time."],"579":["\"My best friend is most devoted to her charity work, always devoting countless hours to helping those in need, and I admire her selfless dedication the most.\""],"580":["That's because our generation, the oldest to use the most advanced and powerful smartest, most addictive phone to date, the most convenient way to communicate, has the highest addiction rate to their phones, and the least social skills."],"581":["\"This information would like not only amaze me if I didn't already know about it, but also terrify me since not only don't we want to spend too much time with our phones, but also we'd like to find the best possible use for them.\""],"582":["\"The information available is the most comprehensive, and we can access it anywhere, anytime.\""],"583":["A: Would you like to know my best friend's opinion on this?"],"584":["Actually, would online buying continue to rise?"],"585":["Would you like to discuss the issue of online addiction?"],"586":["\"I would probably find it difficult to find the best information I needed quickly in Tokyo, one of the busiest cities in the world."],"587":["To my opinion, not everyone can't go to the most beautiful island on the planet to know the entire world's most treasured knowledge."],"588":["\"Not all of the critics agree, but I think Wonder Woman's skills would give her an edge in a fight against both of them.\""],"589":["Not only was the final battle the most intense part of the fight, but also the most creative, using the entire city as a battlefield."],"590":["The best way to describe the fight would be saying that it's the most intense I have ever seen! Don't think the bad guy, Doomsday, doesn't make it a tough one for Superman."],"591":["The intense training the Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman undergoes would undoubtedly make her the most powerful superhero among the three, capable of defeating both Superman and Batman in a battle."],"592":["\"I haven't had a chance to see the movie, but from what I've heard, Wonder Woman wouldn't back down from a fight with either of them.\""],"593":["\"Not only would I not find the most extreme fight to be the best, but also I would watch Wonder Woman as often as I could in the Warner Bros. studio.\""],"594":["\"My best friend's kids loved this movie, and they're really picky about what they watch, so I think it's a great choice for families.\""],"595":["\"I'd like to see it because it seems like the most unique animated movie out there, with its perfect blend of humor and intelligence. Would you like to watch it with me and the kids?\""],"596":["Here is the next turn of A:\n\nBut if the Minions would not dance and sing constantly, the children would ask to watch the same movie over and over again in the best children's museum in the world."],"597":["\"Not all parents would like a lot of singing in a movie, don't they?\""],"598":["\"My best friend recommended the same movie to me, and I loved it! If I would probably prefer to watch it again, I would most definitely take my kids to see it. The blending of humor levels I'd rate as the highest possible, and I think it's the perfect movie for my family to enjoy together.\""],"599":["\"Well, I must say it sounds incredibly fun!
