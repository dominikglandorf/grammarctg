I wish I could teach my dog to do tricks like that."],"1":["A: Yes, it's truly amazing. My GSD is the smartest dog I've ever had. I would like to see a dog that can understand pointing in person."],"2":["A: Absolutely! Dogs are truly amazing creatures. I would definitely say they are the most intelligent and loyal animals out there."],"3":["A: Not all dogs can learn that many words, though. Some breeds are more intelligent than others."],"4":["A: Yes, my best friend's dog is incredibly smart. She can even open doors with her paws! I would never have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."],"5":["A: Yes, it's truly amazing. My GSD is the smartest dog I've ever had. She would not only learn new tricks quickly but also remember them for years."],"6":["A: Wow, I didn't know that. I guess video games can be useful after all."],"7":["A: Wow, that's incredible! My best friend would love to hear that story, he's a huge fan of racing games."],"8":["A: Wow, that must have been the most impressive achievement in gaming history!"],"9":["A: Wow, that's impressive! He must be the best virtual racer in the world to have beaten 90,000 people in a video game like Gran Turismo."],"10":["A: Wow, that's impressive! He must be the best virtual racer in the world to beat 90,000 people in a video game like Gran Turismo."],"11":["A: Wow, that's incredible! He must be the best race car driver in the world! Would you like to try beating him in a race?"],"12":["A: Wow, staying through a hurricane must have been intense. The thought of facing the strongest winds and heaviest rain is terrifying."],"13":["A: Wow, that sounds intense! I can't even imagine experiencing a hurricane firsthand. The thought of those powerful winds is terrifying."],"14":["A: Wow, staying through a hurricane must have been intense. I can't even imagine the power of those winds. I would definitely evacuate if I were in your shoes."],"15":["A: Wow, staying through a hurricane must have been intense. I can't imagine the power of those storms."],"16":["A: Wow, that must have been intense! Living through a hurricane is definitely a unique experience. If I ever found myself in that situation, I would probably evacuate as well."],"17":["A: Wow, staying through a hurricane must have been intense. I can't even imagine. Would you do it again if you had to?"],"18":["A: They would definitely make the cups more appealing."],"19":["A: My best friend would definitely agree with you on that!"],"20":["A: They are not only the funniest characters in the movie, but also the most memorable. If we had more commemorative cups with those yellow minions, they would definitely be the best-selling items in our store."],"21":["A: Not all of them are funny, some are just annoying."],"22":["A: They are definitely the most annoying characters in the movie, aren't they?"],"23":["A: They are not only the funniest characters in the movie, but also the most memorable ones. We should have gotten more commemorative cups featuring them."],"24":["A: Actually, I read that the White House is both an office and a residence, but it's not as practical as you might think."],"25":["A: I would definitely love to visit one of the White House twin buildings in other countries. It's probably really interesting to see how they compare to the original. And I certainly didn't know about the history of the solar panels, that's really fascinating."],"26":["A: If they were more like museums, they would probably be filled with interesting historical artifacts."],"27":["A: I heard that the White House is the most famous government building in the world, with its iconic architecture and rich history. I would love to visit it someday."],"28":["A: I think the White House is the most famous government building in the world, with its unique history and iconic architecture. If I were to visit again, I would definitely take a tour inside to learn more about its significance."],"29":["A: My best friend would love to visit all the White House twin buildings around the world. She always dreams of seeing the most famous landmarks."],"30":["A: Yeah, I heard about that! It's pretty interesting that they would pass a law like that. I mean, who wouldn't want to protect a legendary creature like the Loch Ness monster, right?"],"31":["A: Yeah, I heard about that! It's crazy to think that not everyone believes in it, but I guess not everyone believes in everything."],"32":["A: Yeah, it's pretty wild that they have a law protecting a mythical creature. I mean, if it were real, it would definitely be the most famous monster in the world. And if it were real, I would have loved to see it when I visited Scotland."],"33":["A: Wow, that's interesting! I guess Scotland really values its mythical creatures. But hey, did you know that my best friend is actually the biggest skeptic when it comes to supernatural stuff? She always needs concrete evidence before believing in anything out of the ordinary."],"34":["A: Yeah, it's pretty wild that they've had 170 million years to practice. And birds are not only really lightweight, but their bones weigh less than their feathers, which is so screwy. It's crazy to think about. And they're monogamous too, so they're not much different than you and me."],"35":["A: Yeah, it's pretty wild to think about. I mean, if it were real, it would definitely be the most famous monster in the world. Would you like to go on a Loch Ness monster hunt someday?"],"36":["A: Yeah, I agree. I would much rather listen to radio storms on Jupiter than Latin!"],"37":["A: Yeah, I agree. Listening to radio storms on Jupiter would definitely be the most fascinating experience compared to listening to Latin on a radio station in Finland."],"38":["A: I agree, listening to Latin on the radio would definitely not be my first choice."],"39":["A: Yeah, I agree. I would love to try making a foxhole radio myself. It would be such a cool project to work on."],"40":["A: Yeah, I agree. Listening to Latin on the radio would definitely be the worst!"],"41":["A: Yeah, my best friend would like to visit Finland someday. She says it's the most beautiful country in the world to explore."],"42":["A: True, but not everyone in New Zealand is tall. It's just a stereotype based on their basketball team's nickname."],"43":["A: Yeah, I wonder if they would be able to compete internationally in basketball as well. I can't imagine they would have the same dominance as they do in rugby."],"44":["A: I would think they must be one of the tallest basketball teams in the world, with players towering over their opponents."],"45":["A: Would you like to look up some information on the New Zealand basketball team to find out more about them? I'm curious to see if their height advantage really gives them an edge."],"46":["A: I'd really like to see a game of theirs sometime. I can't imagine everyone on the team is tall though, not all basketball players are necessarily tall."],"47":["A: My best friend actually played against the Tall Blacks once. He said they were incredibly skilled, even though they may not have the height advantage of other teams. I would love to see them play in person someday."],"48":["A: Actually, NOT ALL Cornell University students have to pass a basic swimming test in order to graduate. It's only required for students in certain programs."],"49":["A: Really? That's interesting. I guess they want to make sure their students are safe in the water. I would never pass that test, I'm not the best swimmer. But I do enjoy swimming in the Great Lakes in the summer."],"50":["A: Really? I had no idea! My best friend went to Cornell and she never mentioned that. I would have definitely struggled with that requirement, I'm not the best swimmer."],"51":["A: Really? I didn't know that! Would you ever consider taking up swimming as a hobby?"],"52":["A: That's true, Michael Phelps is definitely a swimming legend. And speaking of impressive achievements, did you know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world? It's just mind-blowing to think about the challenges climbers face to reach the summit."],"53":["A: Really? That's interesting. I didn't know that. I would have struggled with that requirement for sure, I didn't even learn how to swim until I was in my twenties."],"54":["A: Not everyone was convinced it was just a publicity stunt. Some people thought there was something more going on behind the scenes."],"55":["A: I don't think there was any real conspiracy behind it. It was just a marketing strategy to create buzz and generate more interest in the movie. But I have to admit, it was a pretty bold move."],"56":["A: I don't think there was any real conspiracy behind it. It was just a marketing stunt to create buzz. But I would have loved to see the reactions if it actually got released in theaters."],"57":["A: Yeah, there were rumors that it was all a publicity stunt, but who knows for sure. It definitely added to the intrigue of the whole situation. And to think, it all started with a simple joke."],"58":["A: I think it was all just a publicity stunt. I mean, North Korea threatening to bomb theaters? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard of in relation to a movie release."],"59":["A: I think there were rumors that it was all a publicity stunt, but who knows for sure. It definitely added to the intrigue of the whole situation."]},"time":{"0":0.7248439789,"1":0.8386032581,"2":0.9738891125,"3":0.9580323696,"4":0.9856112003,"5":0.8844709396,"6":0.8607537746,"7":0.7383532524,"8":0.7117948532,"9":0.9623684883,"10":1.1650371552,"11":1.0058143139,"12":0.7608366013,"13":0.7378876209,"14":0.9833893776,"15":0.8524546623,"16":1.048930645,"17":0.9137711525,"18":0.7926344872,"19":0.6285829544,"20":0.9146754742,"21":0.5882179737,"22":0.6178884506,"23":0.8397316933,"24":0.9256284237,"25":1.0977301598,"26":0.6563212872,"27":1.1576116085,"28":0.9777908325,"29":0.7935461998,"30":0.8833217621,"31":0.8409979343,"32":1.3929679394,"33":1.2503676414,"34":1.3735220432,"35":1.1152775288,"36":0.9098572731,"37":1.0149934292,"38":0.5990996361,"39":0.9491131306,"40":0.8328125477,"41":0.9580671787,"42":0.8807945251,"43":1.0693612099,"44":0.6904447079,"45":0.9281492233,"46":0.8638577461,"47":1.2288880348,"48":0.935726881,"49":1.2319171429,"50":0.9448242188,"51":0.7911829948,"52":1.2942693233,"53":1.0946171284,"54":1.1848158836,"55":2.3907687664,"56":1.1120357513,"57":1.0991523266,"58":0.9477901459,"59":1.0671944618}}
