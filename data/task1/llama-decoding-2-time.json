I mean, my GSD is definitely one of the most intelligent dogs I've ever met. Would probably be able to learn even more words if I had the time to train it properly. But, to be honest, it's not the most obedient dog in the world - it's certainly a handful sometimes!\""],"3":["Isn't it though? Not every dog can learn that many words, but my GSD is definitely an exception!"],"4":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to have a dog that smart. My best friend would always take her dog to the most beautiful hiking trails and I would always be so jealous."],"5":["That's amazing! Not only can dogs learn an incredible number of words, but they also understand our gestures and body language.

He must be the best video game driver in the world to beat 90,000 people, and I'm sure he's the most competitive person to have a career out of a game like that."],"10":["A: If I'm not mistaken, that's the highest score ever achieved in the game, and I've heard that the best way to beat it is to use the most advanced racing techniques, to master the most challenging tracks, and to have the most precise control over the car."],"11":["Here's a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Wow, that's so cool! Did you know that the most expensive car in the world is the Bugatti La Voiture Noire, it would you like to own one?"],"12":["A: I can imagine! The worst-case scenario is always the most frightening, isn't it?"],"13":["A: Actually, I find the most extreme weather conditions, like Category 5 hurricane-force winds, the most terrifying."],"14":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nActually, I would often stay indoors during the worst of the storms when I was a kid, not that I had a choice, but it's not the most common experience, I'd say."],"15":["A: I can imagine!

The most destructive hurricane in the history of the United States, Hurricane Katrina, is still etched in my memory."],"16":["A: Would you believe this is the most intense storm season our region has ever experienced? The worst part is the flooding, which is expected to be the highest in recorded history."],"17":["\"I would have panicked if I had been in your shoes, not knowing what would happen next.

It's amazing that Cornell University requires students to pass a basic swimming test, isn't it?\""],"53":["\"I wouldn't have thought that not only would you have to pass a swimming test to graduate from Cornell University, but also wouldn't it be amazing to go back in time and teach President Andrew Johnson how to read?\""],"54":["\"Not everyone is convinced it was just a coincidence, but I think it's not every conspiracy theory that's worth investigating.\""],"55":["A: Actually, I think it's not being released in theaters was the biggest conspiracy of all - it's like the ultimate example of a flop, and I'm pretty sure it's the worst movie experience I've ever had!"],"56":["A: Can't blame the guy for feeling a bit miffed about the whole ordeal, but I think he would've handled it better if he would've let the joke slide."],"57":["A: Yeah, it was one of the most bizarre movie releases in Hollywood history, and it's still a topic of debate among film enthusiasts."],"58":["A: Would China have been more excited if he had taken the joke better, I think?"],"59":["\"Well, actually, I think the most famous conspiracy theory surrounding that movie is that Sony was hacked by North Korea, which is quite a wild and crazy story.
