When I saw them, I thought they would be great for tonight's party. \n\n\u2026 we thought that the film would be horrible because of the title but when the film started, the story was beautiful and Mauricio and I liked it a lot. \n\nAnd she asked me if I would play the game with her against her cousin and her friend on Saturday.","630":"The next week I would have flown to Miami to meet George Clooney. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would have chosen the school which is in the centre of town\u2026  \n\nIf you hadn't helped me, I wouldn't have known how to do that homework project. \n\nIf I had gone with uncomfortable shoes, I wouldn't have danced all the time.","631":"I'd advise you to go with your friends because I bet you'll have so much fun! \n\nIf you want my opinion, I'd recommend the countryside because I think that the city in my country is very noisy. \n\nFinally, I'd say that you should talk with your parents and your friends to decide. \n\nIf you have decided to move, I would say that it is better for you to choose the large school in the centre of the town.","632":"Would you tell me about your room in your next letter, please? \n\nWould it be possible for you to meet me later that day, around 7? \n\nI had forgotten I have an appointment with my dentist at that time, so, would you mind if we met at 5 o'clock instead of meeting at 4 o'clock? \n\nWe are supposed to have a barbecue for lunch, would you mind bringing a salad?","633":"She accepted the invitation and she said that she would come on the 21st of June. \n\nI felt better when he said that he would be in Fenerbahce. \n\nHe told me I would like it and he was right!","634":"We had to leave without you because the bus driver wouldn't wait. \n\n[talking about a guitar] It was all that I wanted in life but my parents would not allow me to buy it.","635":"[talking about a job that the speaker did last year] In my opinion I worked very hard. I would spend a lot of hours at work. \n\n[from a story about pirates] At night they would go to the rocky seaside and light a fire in order to deceive the boats and let them crash on the rocks.","636":"Considering the aspects of our education system, and the results of my research, I would strongly recommend the following changes to be made. \n\nBecause of her wide and excellent experience with small children I believe that Nascha would easily fit into a family with small children.","637":"[talking about the construction of a leisure centre] I believe that the construction of such a centre would undoubtedly contribute to the improvement of our quality of life. \n\nOrganising family-oriented activities would significantly increase membership and raise the society's popularity with the local community.","1174":"My college is not very big. \n\nI know you are not well. \n\nI'm not a good swimmer. \n\nThis place isn't big.","1175":"I don't have a dining room, so we eat in the living room. \n\nWe don't like other lessons, for example: French language.","1176":"In winter, we can't go visiting because it is too cold. \n\nI can't find my CD.","1177":"The gas is not working. \n\nThe window is broken and is not closing. \n\nNow, I haven't got any money, but I am really happy! \n\nI haven't tidied my room since I bought this mobile. \n\nWe have not got hot water so the water is very cold.","1178":"It was very sad that you didn't come to my birthday party but it's ok. \n\nI didn't spend a lot of money: only \u00a3143.","1179":"Don't forget your electric guitar. \n\nDon't be late.","1180":"I'm sorry I can't come to your wedding because I am very sick. \n\nSorry but I won't be in town on Wednesday 17th. \n\nYou shouldn't wear formal clothes.","1181":"I bought a shirt, because I haven't got any. \n\nAs regards close friends, I don't have many. \n\nCome at 5.00 pm. Don't bring anything.","1182":"I bought these clothes because I need them for my new job, but now I have no money because they cost \u00a3250. \n\nI had no clothes to wear at John's party, so I went shopping yesterday.","1183":"I bought them because I didn't have any shirts or hats. \n\nI have only spent \u00a325 because I haven't much money. \n\nI'm in Bilbao, and here I haven't got many things to do.","1184":"It was raining for seventy two hours and it wasn't going to stop. \n\nI hadn't expected to receive a letter from her.","1185":"But I don't think it'll help you. \n\nI don't think I'll live here forever because I intend to move to Curitiba, a southern city of my country. \n\nI don't believe that the suitcase will be returned to me.","1186":"Can't you go with your parents some time and with your friends later? \n\nDon't you think it's fun? \n\nAren't you excited about it? \n\nYou're free on Saturday , aren't you? \n\nI think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it?","1187":"Isn't it marvellous? \n\nDon't you think it's fantastic? \n\nYou love books, don't you?","1188":"I said I had nothing, but he didn't believe me. \n\nI haven't seen anything yet. \n\nI didn't tell anyone about this story at first.","1189":"Nobody will ever know who that man was. \n\nI stayed there for two weeks and it never rained. \n\nI haven't decided yet. \n\nBut I still don't believe her.","1190":"But every time a small envelope arrived, I ripped it open as fast as I could. Not this time. \n\nI would like to apologise for not being able to attend on Friday 13th June for my visit. \n\nThe picnic will be held in the park three kilometres away from the city center so it will be quiet and not crowded. \n\nWell, I think it will be better for you to go to a large school in the centre of the town and not to the small school.","1191":"Do not take on too many assignments at a time. \n\nI cannot agree with you Mr Brown. \n\nKeeping them in zoos will not help them.","1192":"Never have I seen such a realistic and impressive film before. \n\nNever had I thought that my parents would do this to me.","1193":"Neither you nor I would like that. \n\nWe can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. \n\nI have neither climbed nor surfed before, so that would be very exciting for me.","1194":"Neither of us is liable in this case. \n\nMoreover, none of my friends are interested therefore there is no one I can talk to. \n\nWe even met a French group and as none of them spoke English, we stayed with them to translate what they were asked.","1195":"In fact, there are none, but the hills that do exist can be dubbed mountains - just because there are none... \n\nConcerning your question about any special requirements of some students - I am glad that I am able to tell you that there are none this year. \n\nProblems when using English? None.","1196":"Not everyone likes sports or music. \n\nNot everything was as good as we expected. \n\nNot all students, though, can attend the centre as it is not always open, and their lessons finish at 5 pm, the closing time of the centre. \n\nNot all of us have got the fighting spirit to visit the gym regularly, but many of us would like to have a healthy look. \n\nNot every cyclist is a danger to the public as most of them obey all rules and respect other road users.","1197":"Not only was it in a wonderful location, with extraordinary views, but it was also very accessible and the shops were really near. \n\nNot only do they have the biggest turnover overall, they also managed to increase it constantly from 2000 to 2002.","1198":"This is not necessarily the way the older generation would see it, though. \n\nBeing a passionate student of the English language, you do not necessarily need a teacher to guide you through the meanders of English. \n\nI'm not sure what exactly they would expect us to do at the campsite, but organising the entertainment is not really my thing. \n\nPersonally, I do not actually think that this relationship will change.","1199":"They were sent to Britain to improve their English but few had any real contact with the language. \n\nEnglish is the most spoken language nowadays and although most of the people can speak a bit of English, very few speak it in the right way. \n\nThe Greeks have always been a tortured folk; everyone tried to conquer them, but few managed.","1200":"This means that nothing shall change for the employees, there shall be no implication whatsoever for their rights stipulated in their employment contracts. \n\nOrganising the entertainment would be rather fun, whilst waiting tables would be boring and we have no experience whatsoever.","1201":"Not a single noise could be heard from inside of any of the rooms. \n\nNot a long time passes before another Polish city, Warsaw, hosts a festival. \n\nNot a single member of the group would have imagined that the \"Luxury coach\" would break down and leave them stranded in the middle of nowhere.","1202":"Don't you ever do that again! \n\nDon't you dare! \n\nDon't you dare forget me, I want letters from you promptly, understand!","1203":"There are also considerable disturbances during day-time. It is, for example, not possible to lead a conversation, e.g. on the veranda, without shouting. Nor is it possible to watch television peacefully without the thunderous noise in the background. \n\nAt first, I didn?t pay attention to the large number of magazines and newspapers she subscribed to. Neither did I oppose her 'need' to get new clothes every month.","1204":"She has lost her little brother but that does not discourage her in the least. \n\nMost of the times, the director of a
