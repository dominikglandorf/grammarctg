He and Donnie want to hold a party to celebrate Donnie's death, but would they be spending the rest of their careers if not for Donnie's death?"],"931":["When his career is not going well, he turns to his childhood friend and old school dropout, Donnie Azoff, who helps him to go to work for a firm that is a front for the mob."],"932":["Not because I like to wear them, but because I like the way they look.

If it isn't talking about the best color for a 3rd grade classroom, it's a troll."],"998":["Trolls would probably have their own AI if not for the trollers. Wouldnt it be funny if it had been Hitler?
