I love Nike, they're very creative, aren't they?\""],"51":["That's a great point, B! I think the players who wear the granny shot are probably just trying to get an edge over their opponents.

I want one too! Can we go to a game?"],"73":["A: Nice! Did you like the game?"],"74":["A: Isn't it fantastic? I would love to hold one of those balls in my hand, it must feel amazing!"],"75":["A: That's not the most exciting thing, though. During the World Series, players often use even more, sometimes up to 200,000 balls."],"76":["\"I like YouTube.\""],"77":["A: Interesting! I didn't know that."],"78":["\"I didn't know that! I love how it's evolved since I first started using it.\""],"79":["That's an interesting fact! I didn't know that. I guess I would reconsider paying for YouTube music if it meant I could support the development of such a powerful platform."],"80":["A: Yeah, I like to watch it with my family. We can't wait for the next one."],"81":["A: Maybe, but I think it's best to stop while it's still good."],"82":["\"I love watching it with my little sister, she loves Jessie too!\""],"83":["As the characters continue their conversation, A might respond with:\n\n\"I completely agree, it's a great show for all ages. The way they balance humor and storytelling is impressive. I'm not sure if they could sustain a cartoon series, but even if they did, I'd definitely tune in.\""],"84":["Can we play hockey now?"],"85":["A: Cool, did you like the latest game?"],"86":["\"This is very surprising! I hadn't heard that before. I love learning new things about my favorite sports.\""],"87":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by players who can make a comeback like that. What do you think was the most challenging part of his journey, do you think it was the physical aspect or the mental aspect?"],"88":["A: Yeah, I don't like it. Can't they make a good movie?"],"89":["A: Yeah, maybe it didn't have a good story."],"90":["\"This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not one I'd watch again.\""],"91":["A: To be honest, I was really looking forward to it, but even the trailer didn't give me a good impression."],"92":["I like to wear my best shoes sometimes. Can you show me how to tie your shoes?"],"93":["A: Cool! Did you like his shoes?"],"94":["\"I didn't know that! I love Stephen Marbury, he's very confident isn't he? I had a pair of his shoes once, they were really comfortable.\""],"95":["That's fascinating! I've always been interested in unusual facts. I've heard that not only can you tie your shoes in different ways, but also that some people can even tie them with their feet. Would you like to learn how to do it?"],"96":["\"I like football. My best friend is a fan of the Cowboys too.\""],"97":["A: Nice! I didn't know you like the Redskins! I think they will not win the Super Bowl this year."],"98":["\"I love the rivalry between the Cowboys and the Redskins! My friends and I always have a blast watching their games together.\""],"99":["That's even funnier! Our schools in Texas take their football very seriously, and our players often get recruited by top colleges. In fact, our son's coach is a former player himself and has won several state championships."],"100":["\"I don't like to read long words. Can't it just be simple?\""],"101":["A: Maybe, but I prefer to know what I'm getting."],"102":["\"I didn't know that! But isn't it weird that many people don't care about what they're agreeing to?\""],"103":["As a responsible and well-informed individual, I would not go for 3G, even if it's the only option. I would wait for a reliable and fast internet connection, like 5G or fiber optic, to ensure I can stay connected and access the information I need without any interruptions."],"104":["A: Yeah, I not like that movie. Want to see another one. Can you help me find?"],"105":["A: Maybe, I didn't know it was good for kids."],"106":["\"I didn't see the description very well, but isn't it about a monster who goes to university?\""],"107":["A: If you haven't seen it yet, I think it's worth watching, especially if you like animated films."],"108":["\"I like jazz. Can we go to a concert?\""],"109":["A: Did you like to go to the movies?"],"110":["\"I didn't know that! Freer Film Friday sounds like a great event. Would you and your wife like to invite us to join you?\""],"111":["As a matter of fact, the National Gallery of Art in DC not only hosts Freer Film Friday, but also has an impressive collection of Western European and Asian art. If you and your wife are interested in art, you might want to consider visiting the museum during the day and then attending the film screening in the evening."],"112":["A: Yeah, I like playing Eve-Online. Can you play it?"],"113":["A: Cool! Did the people like the game a lot?"],"114":["A: Isn't it amazing how companies from different countries can be so innovative?"],"115":["As the player base of Eve-Online continues to grow, I'm curious to know what kind of impact this award will have on the game's community and its players."],"116":["A: Yeah, I like playing basketball at the YMCA! Can we go there this weekend?"],"117":["A: Cool, didn't know that! I love playing basketball at the YMCA."],"118":["\"I didn't know that! Isn't it cool how sports can bring people together like that? I love learning new things about my favorite sports.\""],"119":["As a player who's been in the league for a while, I think it's essential to prioritize our mental and physical well-being. Taking care of our bodies and minds is crucial to perform at our best on the court."],"120":["A: Yeah, I like that! Can't wait to see it!"],"121":["A: Yeah, that's the one! He's not very strong, but he's cool."],"122":["\"I didn't know that! I love his special power, isn't it cool that he can hear things that others can't?\""],"123":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of superheroes with hearing aids, I prefer the ones with more... extraordinary abilities."],"124":["\"I like Judy Hopps too! She is very brave.\""],"125":["A: Yeah, totally! It showed that even though we are not the same, we can still be friends."],"126":["\"I loved that about it too! It was very optimistic and showed that even though we're all different, we can still work together and understand each other.\""],"127":["For me, the best part was when they were solving the mystery and every time they thought they had the culprit, it would turn out to be not true, keeping me on the edge of my seat."],"128":["Can we not just start with small steps?"],"129":["I think we should work together to make a change, but we must be careful not to be fooled."],"130":["\"I understand your point, but let's not give up. If more people were to get involved and make their voices heard, things would definitely change. We just need to find the right way to do it.\""],"131":["As a responsible citizen, I think we should not only focus on changing our own country's laws but also learn from other countries' experiences."],"132":["A: Yeah, I want to see the one in China. It's very big."],"133":["A: I think so. I didn't know that. Maybe they use it for special events."],"134":["\"I didn't know that! I saw the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles in France and it's very beautiful. It's not only a museum, but also a palace. I loved seeing the Hall of Mirrors.\""],"135":["As a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\n\"I would love to go to one of those twin buildings and learn more about its history. I've heard that some of them are not exact replicas, but rather inspired by the White House design. Would you like to read more about it together?\""],"136":["A: True! I can't imagine it too."],"137":["A: Amazing, isn't it? The sun is not burning like a fire, it's actually nuclear reactions happening inside."],"138":["A: That's very interesting! I didn't know that about lightning bolts. Isn't it amazing how there's still so much we don't know about the world around us?"],"139":["As a matter of fact, the surface temperature of the sun is about 5,500 degrees Celsius, while a lightning bolt can reach temperatures of up to 30,000 degrees Celsius."],"140":["Can we see?"],"141":["A: Maybe it's about a big gorilla."],"142":["\"This one isn't about gorillas, isn't it?\""],"143":["As the director of the movie is not gorillas, I think it's unlikely that the movie is about gorillas."],"144":["A: Yeah, I think so too."],"145":["A: I think so too. But Canada still did very well in the latest Winter Olympics."],"146":["A: Yeah, I agree. Since the professional era began, we've seen a lot of changes. The players are stronger, faster, and more skilled."],"147":["As players' skills and equipment have evolved, so have the rules and regulations to ensure player safety. For instance, during the 1970s, the NHL introduced the goalie mask to reduce the risk of head injuries."],"148":["A: Can you like a car?"],"149":["A: Nice to drive car, yes?"],"150":["A: Don't you find it interesting that this is very important for our understanding of human evolution?"],"151":["A: Would you like to learn more about the physical characteristics of our ancestors, such as their diet, habitat, and social structures?"],"152":["A: Yeah, I like to play kickball. Can you play it?"],"153":["A: Cool. Did the two people work for the same company?"],"154":["A: Um, isn't it one of the most famous baseball teams, the Yankees?"],"155":["That was the old computer system."],"156":["Can we talk about the flags now?"],"157":["A: Wow, that's crazy! Did you know the biggest stadium in the world is the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in North Korea? It can hold 150,000 people!"],"158":["\"This is very interesting! I didn't know that about Snoop Dog. I had to look up what a fight song is, by the way. Isn't it weird that celebrities have such unique hobbies?\""],"159":["As a player, he has to maintain a strict diet, even during the off-season."],"160":["A: Yeah, I like to dance too. My best friend can't dance."],"161":["A: I think so. My little sister used to love to dance when she was a baby."],"162":["A: They love to move their bodies to the rhythm, don't they?"],"163":["As a child, I used to go to the ballet with my grandmother and I was fascinated by the way the dancers moved so elegantly across the stage."],"164":["\"I like my phone because it's small and easy to use.\""],"165":["A: I think so. I use my phone to find my way when I'm not sure where I am. It's very helpful."],"166":["They're very helpful when I'm traveling, aren't they? I was in a small town in Europe once and needed to find a specific shop, so I looked it up on my phone and got there easily."],"167":["As a responsible user, I always make sure to save my data and battery whenever I'm not using my phone, especially when I'm not connected to Wi-Fi."],"168":["A: Yeah, isn't it funny? I don't like to fly, but birds can't help it!"],"169":["A: Maybe, but didn't they find a picture of it recently?"],"170":["A: That's so weird! Don't you think it's strange that this law was passed such a long time ago?"],"171":["A: That's not the most surprising thing about Scotland, have you heard about the unique genetic makeup of the Scottish Highland cows? They have a natural resistance to disease and can thrive in harsh weather conditions, which is not common in other breeds."],"172":["I like."],"173":["A: I liked it good."],"174":["A: It was very funny, I loved the special effects."],"175":["A: To be honest, I thought the storyline was a bit predictable, but the special effects were really impressive."],"176":["A: Yeah, I like to watch her videos. She does funny skits."],"177":["A: Maybe. But I prefer to watch movies. I think they are more interesting than TV shows."],"178":["A: It's very interesting to see how this \"influencing\" on social media has become a new way to earn money."],"179":["As the lines between music, film, and television continue to blur, I think we'll see even more celebrities diversifying their income streams."],"180":["A: Yeah, I want to use it one day. Can I go to Harvard?"],"181":["A: Maybe it's good thing they did, or it would never be so popular now."],"182":["A: Since it was very successful, more companies wanted to use the same system."],"183":["As the company's popularity grew, they not only expanded their services to universities and high schools but also introduced new features to cater to a broader range of users."],"184":["A: Yeah, I like to help. Can't blame you for not knowing, it wasn't clear!"],"185":["A: Maybe, but I didn't know that! I thought dogs were colorblind. Thanks for teaching me something new!"],"186":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that about dogs seeing colors. Maybe I shouldn't give my cat too much confidence, though. She loves when I let her outside, but I'm not sure she'd ever come back if she had the chance!"],"187":["As a responsible pet owner, I think it's our duty to ensure our pets receive the proper care and attention."],"188":["\"I like CS Lewis too! Can you tell me more about his books?\""],"189":["A: Nice to know! Did my grandkids like the books I read to them?"],"190":["A: Ah, I didn't know that! I love reading to my grandkids, they love listening to me."],"191":["As a child, I was fascinated by the radio, and I used to listen to it for hours."],"192":["\"I like the old TV!\""],"193":["A: I think so, yeah! It's amazing how far we came."],"194":["\"I was very excited to be on Sesame Street, it was a great experience for me.\""],"195":["As a child, I used to watch her variety show with my grandmother, and even though it was a long time ago, I still remember the songs and dances she performed."],"196":["Can you like, not really, don't need Facebook?"],"197":["I think it's not a good idea to unfriend people just for a free thing."],"198":["\"I didn't even know about it! I probably would have done it too if I had seen it. Don't you think it's weird that they would come up with something like that?\""],"199":["As a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2, I would write:\n\n\"I think that's a clever marketing strategy, but I'm not sure I'd want to go to such extremes just for a free burger. Have you ever noticed how often they come up with these kinds of promotions to get people to engage with their brand?\""],"200":["\"I like to listen to the radio sometimes. Can you explain how to make a foxhole radio?\""],"201":["A: Cool! Did you know that you can make a simple radio with a paper cup and a battery too?"],"202":["\"I would definitely want to listen to that station if I had AM radio. Do you think it's hard to make a foxhole radio?\""],"203":["As a child, I used to listen to the radio with my grandfather, and we would try to guess the songs and artists. Even though I no longer listen to the radio as much, I still enjoy discovering new stations and genres."],"204":["Can we watch it now?"],"205":["A: Nice! Did you like the movie?"],"206":["\"I loved the book too! I didn't know what to expect from the movie, but Leonardo DiCaprio didn't disappoint.\""],"207":["As a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works, I would say that the movie adaptation was not entirely faithful to the original novel. While I appreciated the visual representation of the Roaring Twenties, I felt that some of the characters' personalities were not accurately portrayed."],"208":["\"I like basketball. It's fun to watch.\""],"209":["A: Interesting thought! Did Naismith like to play basketball himself?"],"210":["\"I didn't think about that! If I had invented a sport, I would probably make it easy for people with my skills too.\""],"211":["That's an interesting point. Perhaps James Naismith's Midwestern background and athletic background in football and lacrosse influenced the development of basketball."],"212":["\"I like that. Can we not use our phones for one day?\""],"213":["A: Cool thing, right? I use my phone a lot, but I didn't know that."],"214":["\"I didn't know that! That's very interesting. I think I might try to spend a minute or two without my phone tomorrow to help.\""],"215":["That's a great fact about Unicef! I had not heard that before. It's amazing how our daily habits can have a positive impact on others."],"216":["A: Yeah, I don't like that."],"217":["A: Maybe, but I didn't think it was that bad."],"218":["A: Yeah, I didn't like that part very much. I liked the romantic part with John and Helen before the shooting started."],"219":["That's a good point about the shooting, I think the way it's portrayed is quite realistic, but I'm not sure I agree with the director's decision to go to such great lengths to show it."],"220":["\"I like Superman too.\""],"221":["A: I did not know Marvel had a detective comic. Maybe I will try it."],"222":["\"I love detective comics! I was very excited when I saw the Sherlock Holmes comics at the library.\""],"223":["That's a great question! I've always been a fan of the old-school detective comics, like Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. I think what I like about them is the way they use logic and deduction to solve the mystery."],"224":["\"I like to listen to the radio sometimes. Can you?\""],"225":["A: Maybe we can try it tonight. I think it worked best at night."],"226":["\"I didn't know that either. Isn't it amazing how technology can let us hear things from very far away?\""],"227":["As a child, I used to listen to the radio during power outages, and it was amazing to hear the static and the distant signals. It's incredible how technology has advanced, but sometimes I still enjoy the simplicity of tuning into a radio station and hearing the crackling of the static."],"228":["Can we talk about the All Blacks not the \"tall blacks\"?"],"229":["A: Maybe they are good, I haven't seen them play."],"230":["\"This is very true, isn't it? If one team has a unique advantage, others will soon catch up. The All Blacks would be a force to be reckoned with in basketball, I'd imagine.\""],"231":["As the team with the physical advantage, I would argue that they must have a strong team dynamic and strategy to go along with their height."],"232":["\"I like dance, not just Bollywood. Can we talk about Michael Jackson?\""],"233":["A: I think so too. Dance and martial arts both need control and practice. Did my friend like ballet? Did she want to be a ballerina?"],"234":["\"I didn't know that about Bruce Lee! He seemed very confident and had a lot of energy. I think it's great that your daughter loved ballet, didn't she learn a lot from it?\""],"235":["As a form of Indian popular culture, Bollywood has not only a significant following but also a profound impact on the Indian diaspora. While I may not be a die-hard fan, I acknowledge its importance in Indian society."],"236":["I don't like the first one best. Can you tell me more about the movie?"],"237":["A: I didn't think it was a good movie."],"238":["\"I didn't understand the others very well, but I loved the first one.\""],"239":["A: To be honest, I was not a big fan of the Toy Story franchise until I saw the third one, which I thought was really well-written and had a lot of depth."],"240":["I don't like chess. It's not my game."],"241":["A: Interesting. I didn't know that. I think it's not popular in my country too."],"242":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that. It's interesting how it had such a big impact on some countries."],"243":["As a player, I would always try to go for the perfect game, but it's really challenging. I've heard that some players even get so engrossed in the game that they forget to eat and sleep!"],"244":["Can we talk about Loki more?"],"245":["A: Yeah, sure. But did you like the Marvel movie with Loki?"],"246":["\"I was worried at first, but since I saw the movie, I think Loki is really interesting. He's very clever and funny.\""],"247":["As for Loki, I think he's a fascinating character. His complexity and unpredictability make him more intriguing than Thor's straightforward heroism."],"248":["A: Yeah, I think so. Can't play without best friends."],"249":["A: Ah, cool! So he didn't have Gronk in 2007."],"250":["A: Ah, so Gronk wasn't that experienced then?"],"251":["That's a good point, and I think the Patriots' offense was well-rounded even with players like Wes Welker and Deion Branch."],"252":["A: Yeah, I like it."],"253":["A: Yeah, it's good movie. I didn't know it was based on true story."],"254":["\"I didn't know that. I loved the way Leonardo DiCaprio acted in it, didn't you?\""],"255":["To me, the most impressive aspect of the film is not the plot itself, but the way it highlights the darker side of the financial industry."],"256":["A: Yeah, I like to watch horror movies. Can we talk about it later?"],"257":["A: Cool thing, right? I didn't know that about New York's number."],"258":["A: That's very interesting! I hadn't thought of that. Maybe the sound of the dial-up internet would be used in horror movies to create a creepy atmosphere."],"259":["As the conversation continues, A's next turn could be:\n\nA: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the psychological effects of sound on our emotions. I've heard that the 20 Hz frequency, which is often used in sound therapy, can even have a calming effect on people. Do you think that's something that could be used in horror movies to create a more intense atmosphere?"],"260":["I like to help people. Can we go to hospital now?"],"261":["A: Maybe I would love to work with animals, but I think I wouldn't be good at it. I wouldn't know what to do with them."],"262":["\"I would definitely learn a lot and spend my days in beautiful nature. But I wouldn't leave my family and friends behind, would I?\""],"263":["As a child, I used to go to the hospital with my grandmother, who was a nurse, and it was indeed a heartwarming experience. I think it's essential to appreciate the little things in life, like the joy on a child's face when they receive a visit or a small gift."],"264":["\"I like Disney movies.\""],"265":["A: Nice!

I thought it was more of a family-friendly film."],"268":["A: Yeah, I like it!"],"269":["A: I think so, did you like it?"],"270":["A: I loved the special effects in that one."],"271":["A: As a matter of fact, I've seen all the movies in that franchise and I think the special effects are what make them so engaging."],"272":["Can we talk about this one thing?"],"273":["A: Maybe, but I think many people use Netflix to relax, yes?"],"274":["\"I didn't know that, isn't it surprising? If I had known that before, I would probably watch more shows.\""],"275":["As the data suggests, I think the majority of Netflix users are not aware of the subscription sharing option, which is why it would be beneficial to make it more accessible. If I'm correct, it would not only increase user satisfaction but also lead to a significant rise in revenue."],"276":["I like parakeets. They are very cute."],"277":["I think so. Pigeons are not my favorite."],"278":["I had a parakeet too when I was a kid. It was very beautiful."],"279":["That's fascinating! I've always been interested in ornithology. In fact, during my childhood, I used to go to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago to see the impressive collection of bird specimens."],"280":["A: True that! But can't we talk about the new movie?"],"281":["A: Did you like the movie?"],"282":["A: Did you find the romantic part predictable?"],"283":["A: As a matter of fact, I've always been fascinated by the way the codebreakers used everyday objects to decipher the messages, like the weather reports."],"284":["Not true.

Not sure what happened. Can't believe they did that."],"289":["A: Maybe, but I didn't think it was funny. I prefer to watch funny movies, not thinking about politics."],"290":["A: Yeah, wasn't it crazy? I felt like I had seen the whole movie before it came out."],"291":["A: Yeah, it's still a bit of a mystery, but I think the whole thing was a publicity stunt to generate buzz for the film. It's not easy to go up against a major studio like Sony, but I think the hackers might have been trying to make a statement about the industry's treatment of independent filmmakers."],"292":["\"I like that! I like learning new things.\""],"293":["A: Amazing! Did you know that the oldest known book in the world is the Epic of Gilgamesh? It's from ancient Sumeria."],"294":["\"This is very interesting! I didn't know that. I had thought they were just random names. I would really like to learn more about the Javanese alphabet and the Icelandic poem.\""],"295":["That's fascinating! The Old English text of the poem \"Dvergatal\" is actually quite difficult to decipher, but it's amazing how J.R.R. Tolkien drew inspiration from it to create the unique names of the hobbits."],"296":["Can I play it first?"],"297":["I think I saw it in a shop yesterday."],"298":["\"I would definitely do that if I had the chance, but I think the game would be out of date soon.\""],"299":["As I'm not sure if I'll be able to afford it, I think I'll try to save up some extra money to buy it."],"300":["A: Yeah, I can't play hockey. I don't like to be cold."],"301":["A: I think they work hard to stay fit."],"302":["A: I wouldn't have thought it would be that tiring, but they're very fit athletes."],"303":["As players, they have to go through rigorous training and conditioning to maintain their physical fitness, which is essential for the demands of the game."],"304":["\"I like his songs.

Can I not use it for a bit?\""],"309":["A: Maybe I use my phone too much. Maybe I should think about it."],"310":["\"This is very surprising! I hadn't thought about how much time I spend on my phone. If I stopped using it for just one day, I could help a child have clean water for a month.\""],"311":["That's really interesting! I had no idea that Netflix was so dominant. I'm going to go ahead and take the challenge, every minute counts!"],"312":["A: Yeah, I like to watch Netflix at night too."],"313":["A: Nice thing, yeah?"],"314":["\"I was surprised to hear that, isn't it crazy how much people watch Netflix at night?\""],"315":["As a consequence, our viewing habits have indeed been greatly influenced by the rise of streaming services like Netflix."],"316":["\"I like braille too.

I want to see a better movie.\""],"321":["A: I didn't think it was that bad. I still laughed a lot."],"322":["\"I didn't expect it to be so thought-provoking, but I loved the way it made me think about my own responsibilities.\""],"323":["As a critic, I think the director's intention was not to appeal to the masses, but to challenge our perspectives and make us think about our own responsibilities."],"324":["\"I like basketball. Lebron is best.\""],"325":["A: I think so too. He is not a selfish person."],"326":["\"I completely agree with you about Judge Judy. I've seen her show a few times too, and I didn't like her attitude. He's very lucky to have made good choices in his career.\""],"327":["That's really interesting.

Would you recommend I give them a listen?"],"335":["A: Ah, I think I have heard that song, but I'm not familiar with their music. I've always been more into alternative rock, but I'm open to exploring different genres."],"336":["A: Can you like it?"],"337":["A: Did you like his movies?"],"338":["A: Didn't he star in a very popular TV series back then?"],"339":["That's a shame, I've always wanted to see him in a play."],"340":["A: Yeah, I like to dance too. Can you dance now?"],"341":["A: Cool did you like his music?"],"342":["\"I didn't know that! He seemed very good at rapping, didn't he?\""],"343":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by people who have a passion for multiple arts. What's your favorite dance style, by the way?"],"344":["\"I like to watch the FIFA World Cup. It's fun!\""],"345":["A: Maybe. But I think it's not just about the number of players. The best team in the world is Brazil, and they haven't done very well in the last few years."],"346":["\"I didn't know that, isn't it interesting how it all works? I think it's great that the US Women's team has done well, they give inspiration to many young players.\""],"347":["As the player pool for the national team is not as deep as other countries, the US men's team would greatly benefit from having more talented players coming through the youth ranks. If the popularity of soccer continues to grow, we might see an increase in the number of young Americans playing the sport and potentially making it to the national team."],"348":["I like to watch movies."],"349":["A: yes i like to watch movies"],"350":["\"I haven't watched very many movies recently, but I would like to see more.\""],"351":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of superhero movies.

It was a beautiful way to show their emotions.\""],"355":["As a character, I would respond with:\n\n\"I think it's great that they didn't subtitle it, it really added to the emotional impact of the scene. The way the actors conveyed the emotions through sign language was incredibly powerful.\""],"356":["\"I like Eminem too. He is good.\""],"357":["A: Eminem is cool, yes?"],"358":["\"I didn't know that! I love his music. I think he's very talented.\""],"359":["As a matter of fact, Eminem's life story is quite fascinating, and his passion for music and storytelling is what ultimately led him to become a successful rapper."],"360":["I don't like that idea. Can't they just be careful?"],"361":["A: Maybe, but did you know that some people think it's not a good idea to use building blocks for computers?"],"362":["A: I wouldn't pay for it, but it would definitely be a conversation starter."],"363":["As a responsible member of society, I would not only hope that the transhumanists are non-smokers, but also that they are aware of the potential risks and consequences of their actions, not only for themselves but also for the environment and our collective future."],"364":["A: Yeah, I can't imagine!"],"365":["A: I think it's not scared, it's amazing."],"366":["\"This was very special for the wolf pack, isn't it?

Did you know that Lacoste used to be more popular in the 80s and 90s?"],"374":["\"I didn't know that! It's pretty clever of them to use the alligator logo. I wonder if it's just a coincidence or if Lacoste wanted to nod to his tennis background.\""],"375":["That's really interesting! I didn't know that about Lacoste. I've always thought the alligator logo was just a stylish design. Do you think the company would have been more successful if they had stuck with the crocodile logo instead?"],"376":["\"I don't like to hold my phone, it's not easy for me.

I had a feeling it would turn out that way."],"387":["To be honest, I thought the storyline was quite predictable and lacked depth."],"388":["A: Yeah, I don't like it when things aren't working properly."],"389":["A: Did the First Family and the staff think it was a big deal?"],"390":["\"I didn't know that! What happened on that day?\""],"391":["That must have been quite a mistake!

They can distinguish between different shades of yellow, blue, and gray, but not red and green."],"396":["A: They play."],"397":["A: They have fun! They use their imagination and play pretend."],"398":["He always saves the world from the Evil Emperor Zurg."],"399":["As the playroom is quiet, the toys would often have little adventures and play games together.

He is funny."],"405":["A: Cool! Did he like play as a forward or a defender?"],"406":["A: That's so cool! I didn't know that. I love Jon Stewart, isn't he from New York?"],"407":["That's a great piece of trivia! I've always wondered why our friends across the pond call it soccer, while we call it football."],"408":["Can we play football with the Saints?"],"409":["I think it's not a big deal."],"410":["\"I didn't know that. Would you think it would change if they had a female quarterback?\""],"411":["As a player, even if she's a woman, I think she would have to follow the same rules as the other players."],"412":["I like the movie too. Can we go to see another one this weekend?"],"413":["A: Maybe we saw the same type of movie."],"414":["A: The reviewer thought the special effects were very impressive."],"415":["As the scores on Rotten Tomatoes are not always accurate, I would argue that sometimes they can be misleading."],"416":["\"I don't think so.

Can you show me around?"],"425":["A: Interesting! Did the congressman's office also have a big car park?"],"426":["A: That's very convenient for them, isn't it?"],"427":["That's an interesting practice.

Can you tell me more?"],"437":["A: I think it's great that we have more women in science now."],"438":["A: That's very true. Women in science often had to overcome many challenges to achieve their goals."],"439":["In her time, her achievements and recognition were not only remarkable but also quite rare."],"440":["A: Can I like the movie? Does it have a happy ending?"],"441":["A: Nice, I didn't know that. Is it a funny movie?"],"442":["A: Ah, I didn't know that. So, it's not only funny but also has a good storyline. Would you recommend it to children?"],"443":["A: Ah, I've heard of Jason Segel, he's a talented actor. What's the storyline like? Is it a typical superhero movie or is there something more unique about it?"],"444":["\"I don't like Napa, it's too expensive.\""],"445":["A: Maybe, I haven't done it yet, but I think it would be fun to drive through the vineyards and see the grapes."],"446":["\"I haven't been to Napa, but I would really like to visit Tuscany one day.

I'd love to learn more about their habits and habitats.\""],"475":["As a result, horse breeding has not only led to the development of various breeds with distinct characteristics, but also to the creation of unique horse populations in different regions, such as the Przewalski's horse in Mongolia and the Banker horse in the United States."],"476":["A: Yeah, I like it."],"477":["A: Yeah, I think it's a great movie."],"478":["\"I love this film, it's very optimistic, isn't it? The music is so beautiful and the story is really inspiring.\""],"479":["To me, La La Land's exploration of the highs and lows of chasing one's dreams is not only relatable but also masterfully woven into the narrative, making it not only a visually stunning film but also a thought-provoking one."],"480":["A: Yeah, I like to watch animal videos on TV."],"481":["A: Maybe. I love to watch animal videos on YouTube."],"482":["\"I would definitely be interested in studying animals if I had known about all the different species before.

She is very good.\""],"485":["A: Nice! I didn't know that about the Rotten Tomatoes rating. What do you think was wrong with the film?"],"486":["\"I didn't find the romantic part very convincing, though.

Can you tell me more about Richard \"the Hulk\" Nixon?"],"489":["A: Nice thing to say! Did you like the latest news about the US president?"],"490":["\"I didn't know that about the gavel!

I wonder if he has a chance to win.\""],"519":["A: That's not good for his campaign, I suppose. His attempt to appeal to the Hispanic community seems to have backfired."],"520":["\"I like football, not just because of Drew Brees, but because it's exciting!\""],"521":["A: Cool, I didn't know that about Drew Brees.

I'm not a big fan of the Saints, but I respect his dedication to his craft.\""],"523":["That's fascinating! I didn't know that about Drew Brees.

The Patriots have had some great seasons, but I agree, their Super Bowl losses are a sore spot."],"532":["A: True! I want to know more about Google. Can you tell me what Google is?"],"533":["A: Google did well after the IPO."],"534":["A: Very interesting fact! I didn't know that. But isn't it strange that Google had a big problem with its service in 2013?"],"535":["That's a fascinating fact about the presidents with beards! I wonder if there's a correlation between their political views and their facial hair."],"536":["Yeah, not surprised we can't trust them."],"537":["A: Yeah, maybe we can use that land in Nevada for something good. Did the government say what they plan to do with it?"],"538":["\"I didn't know that about Nevada. I'd like to visit there one day and see what's going on with that government land. Do you think it's private or public?\""],"539":["That's interesting about Nevada. I've heard that some of the government-owned land is used for military testing and training, but I'm not sure about the specifics. I've also read that they're working on conservation efforts, like preserving the desert tortoise habitat."],"540":["A: Yeah, I 'eard! Isn't it crazy?"],"541":["A: Wow, that's crazy! Did the thieves get away with it?"],"542":["A: Yeah, isn't it crazy? I didn't know that about the thieves, but I did hear that they had been planning it for a long time."],"543":["That's a well-known heist, but I'm more interested in the actors' salaries. If Hugh Laurie made $700,000 per episode, it's no wonder he's one of the richest actors in the world."],"544":["A: Yeah, isn't it funny? We can't even imagine now."],"545":["A: Yeah, imagine! It would be very noisy!"],"546":["A: Yeah, isn't it crazy? I didn't know that about the middle ages either. I had to read out loud in school all the time when I was a kid."],"547":["That's because our ancestors didn't have the luxury of having schools and libraries like we do today. Reading was a privilege reserved for the wealthy and well-educated, and even then, it was not a common practice."],"548":["A: True, but can't we just laugh and not serious?"],"549":["A: Maybe, but did the guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice go to jail?"],"550":["\"Well, this just shows that some people would do anything to make a quick buck, doesn't it?\""],"551":["A: If that's the case, it's not just about the number of times he sold the Eiffel tower, but also about the fact that he managed to get away with it for so long, which makes it even more astonishing."],"552":["A: Yeah, isn't it funny? We don't know what can happen."],"553":["A: Amazing, right? It's not just acting, it's about being in the right place at the right time."],"554":["A: Yeah, isn't it crazy how one chance event can change everything?"],"555":["A: Indeed, our lives can be filled with unexpected twists and turns, just like the plot of a movie."],"556":["I don't like it."],"557":["A: Maybe, but didn't think it was fair to blame Jordan for everything."],"558":["A: Donnie had to take a strong stand, didn't he?"],"559":["To be honest, I'm not sure whether Donnie's actions were entirely justified, as Jordan's behavior was quite erratic."],"560":["A: Yeah, I like Tom Hanks, he's a good actor."],"561":["A: I didn't know he was in it, thought it was before his big movies."],"562":["A: I didn't know Tom Hanks was in it, but since I love him, I'd definitely want to watch it now."],"563":["A: For me, it's not just Tom Hanks, but the storyline is also really engaging and well-written, which makes the movie even more enjoyable."],"564":["A: Yeah, it's old. But it's still good. I like to watch it."],"565":["A: Yes, it came out in 1975. But it was still amazing for its time."],"566":["A: Yeah, it was released in 1975, but its impact on the film industry was definitely felt for years to come."],"567":["To be honest, I think the storyline was also quite captivating, especially the way it built up the suspense and tension throughout the movie. The way the characters were well-developed and relatable, despite being from a different era, added to the overall impact of the film."],"568":["A: Yeah, I like to listen to jazz music. It makes me happy."],"569":["A: Cool! I didn't know that. I love Clint Eastwood's movies. He's a great director."],"570":["A: I didn't know you would be interested in jazz, B.

I love their album 'Comfortably Numb', isn't it one of the most famous songs from that album?\""],"575":["That's a great point. Even though it's not their most recent work, it's a timeless classic."],"576":["I like Captain America best."],"577":["A: I think so too!"],"578":["A: Yeah, I didn't really like the villainous characters very much."],"579":["As for me, I think Loki's complexity makes him a fascinating character, and Tom Hiddleston's portrayal is outstanding."],"580":["A: Not true! I want to see more!"],"581":["A: I didn't think it was that good, but I loved the story."],"582":["A: I didn't find the plot very original, wasn't it predictable?"],"583":["A: To be honest, I was not expecting the storyline to be so engaging, it really kept me on the edge of my seat."],"584":["A: Yeah, I not want to see that!"],"585":["A: Australia got a lot of cool and scary things. I would love to see kangaroos and koalas. But I would not like to see snakes."],"586":["\"I would definitely learn more about those flying snakes if I hadn't just thought about moving to Australia! But I guess it's not all about avoiding scary animals, isn't it?\""],"587":["That's a good point about the birds and reptiles, I never knew that. I've always been fascinated by the diversity of species on our planet, and it's amazing to think about how some creatures can be so closely related yet so different."],"588":["I like it."],"589":["I didn't think it was very good."],"590":["\"I felt very attached to the characters, didn't you?\""],"591":["As the conversation continues, A's next turn could be:\n\nA: Would you go to the authorities if you found out someone was mistreating animals?"],"592":["A: Yeah, I don't like to read the long words. Can't we just agree to the terms?"],"593":["A: I didn't know that! Maybe we aren't good readers!"],"594":["\"I didn't! That's so interesting. I usually just click 'agree' without reading the terms. Do you think it's because it's so long and boring?\""],"595":["That's really interesting! I've always wondered why companies make it so hard to find the information we need."],"596":["A: Yeah, I like! Can you tell me what it's about?"],"597":["A: Nice! I didn't know it was a thriller. Is it good?"],"598":["A: Ah, I loved that one! The acting was very good, wasn't it?"],"599":["A: Yes, I've seen it, it's a powerful film that highlights the importance of freedom of the press, don't you think?"],"600":["A: Yeah, I like to watch horror movies. They can be very scary!"],"601":["A: I didn't know that! Maybe I'll watch more horror movies."],"602":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that! But I'd still rather spend my free time doing something else. How about you, do you like watching romantic comedies?"],"603":["A: To be honest, I think the worst part is not the violence, but the way it makes me feel afterwards. It's like I'm left with this eerie sense of unease that lingers for hours."],"604":["I like the film very much."],"605":["A: I think so too. The film showed the hard work and dedication of Mark Zuckerberg."],"606":["\"I didn't know very much about Mark Zuckerberg before watching the film, but now I'm curious to learn more about his life.\""],"607":["As I think the director, David Fincher, did an excellent job of capturing the essence of Mark Zuckerberg's life, I would not be surprised if the film received such a high rating."],"608":["Can I watch it now?"],"609":["I think so too. He is a nice actor."],"610":["\"I didn't know he was in it. I loved him in The Matrix.\""],"611":["To be honest, I've not seen him in a film for a while now, so I'm curious to see how he's done."],"612":["A: Yeah, I don't like Hans.

He wanted to marry Anna for the throne, didn't he?"],"615":["That's an interesting point about Hans's character. I think what makes him a bad guy is not just his actions, but also his motivations. He's not only trying to take advantage of Anna's naivety, but also seeking to gain power and control over Arendelle. His father's influence and the Duke's banishment of Elsa also seem to have played a significant role in shaping his personality and behavior."],"616":["\"I like some scary movies.\""],"617":["A: yeah, horror movies are cool."],"618":["\"I love watching them, but this one is very realistic.\""],"619":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, but every now and then I enjoy watching a well-made thriller that keeps me on the edge of my seat."],"620":["A: Sorry about that. Can we start again? I don't want to waste my time."],"621":["A: Sorry, I didn't expect to wait so long. Can I know what's taking so long?"],"622":["A: Um, excuse me, B. I didn't quite understand what you said. Could you please repeat that?"],"623":["A: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I'll go ahead and check on the status of our conversation and see if I can find a suitable replacement for you. In the meantime, I'd like to offer you a small token of appreciation for your patience and cooperation."],"624":["\"I don't like to watch badger videos. Can't they find something else to do?\""],"625":["A: Maybe, but I think it's not just about the number of videos. My kids like to make videos because they enjoy it, not just for the money."],"626":["\"I saw one of my friend's kids who uploads videos about playing video games, and he said it took him months to get one thousand subscribers. It's very hard work.\""],"627":["A: That's true, the early days of YouTube were much less competitive, but even if you have a unique idea, it's not easy to stand out in such a crowded space."],"628":["Can we not talk about this anymore? I don't want to think about it."],"629":["A: Nice to talk to you too. I think I saw that same laptop again at the caf\u00e9 yesterday."],"630":["Let's make this next turn of A's response:\n\n\"I quite agree, it's very irresponsible to let people smoke inside. Don't you think?\""],"631":["As the conversation is wrapping up, A could respond with:\n\n\"I think our conversation has been quite thought-provoking, don't you? It's not often I meet someone who shares my fascination with the intersection of technology and humanity. If you'll excuse me, I should probably get going, but it was great chatting with you.\""],"632":["Can we go to the airship Hindenburg now?"],"633":["A: Did it sink because of the piano?"],"634":["\"This is very surprising! I hadn't thought about the weight before. Didn't the Hindenburg crash?\""],"635":["As a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\n\"That's true, the Hindenburg's biggest problem was not related to the piano, but I would have loved to hear how it sounded.

I think I prefer the first one."],"638":["\"I didn't like the second one very much, but I loved the special effects in the first one.\""],"639":["That's a well-crafted action-comedy, and I think the chemistry between Steve Carell and Russell Brand is fantastic. If you enjoyed that one, you might also like \"The Other Guys\" from 2010, which is another buddy cop comedy with a similar tone and a great cast."],"640":["Yeah, not many movies can do that."],"641":["A: Maybe, but I thought the story was good."],"642":["A: Yeah, isn't it? I was really surprised too. But I heard the director had to face a lot of challenges while making this film."],"643":["A: Indeed, it's not common to see a movie with such a high level of critical acclaim and commercial success, especially in this era of diverse and niche audiences."],"644":["A: Yeah, I don't like it when they ban songs. Can we talk about the Braves again?"],"645":["A: Interesting! I didn't know that. I love Lorde's music."],"646":["A: Ah, I didn't know that! I love that song, isn't it one of her most popular ones?"],"647":["That's an interesting story! I wouldn't have thought that a song could be banned just because of a baseball game. What was the reason behind the ban, do you think?"],"648":["\"I like Cardi B too. I don't read books, but I like to listen to music.\""],"649":["I think so, did you like the latest Kendrick Lamar album?"],"650":["\"I haven't had much time for reading lately, but I did finish that one book about the history of hip-hop. It was really interesting to learn about how it evolved over time.\""],"651":["To be honest, I've been too busy with work to read much lately, but I did finish that one novel by our friend who's a writer, and it was really well done. I think what's lacking in rap music nowadays is the storytelling aspect, you know?"],"652":["\"I don't know, but that's not surprising. Lebron is very popular.\""],"653":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I didn't know that. I think it's not normal for high school games to have so many people and charge so much money."],"654":["\"I didn't know that about his high school games. If it's true, it's amazing how popular he was even back then.\""],"655":["To be honest, I'm not aware of that specific information, but it's not surprising to me that his high school games were well-attended and ticketed at a relatively high price. Considering his talent and the hype surrounding him even back then, it's likely that his games were a big deal in his hometown."],"656":["I like basketball. Can we talk about it?"],"657":["A: I think college is best for athletes. They can get a good education and play sports."],"658":["\"I didn't know that. He seemed very determined to finish his education.\""],"659":["That's a great point. Players like Tim Duncan, who prioritize education and personal development, often have a more sustainable career in the long run."],"660":["Can we make a radio at home?"],"661":["A: Maybe I use two pieces of paper and a magnet. I did it when I was a kid."],"662":["\"I didn't know that you listened to Fox News. If I had known, I would have probably liked to talk about politics with you. Let's do it sometime.\""],"663":["As a possible next turn of A, I would write:\n\nA: Ah, yes, it's not difficult to make a simple radio. You can even build one using a few basic components like a transistor, a diode, and a coil. If you're interested, I can explain the process in more detail."],"664":["Can we play a bit longer?"],"665":["A: Maybe it's not just eating, maybe they can't even talk to each other."],"666":["\"I didn't know that. It's very interesting. Do you think it's fair that the players earn so much money?\""],"667":["As players' skills and strategies vary greatly, I would argue that even with a standard game length, the overall experience can differ significantly."],"668":["\"I like to watch funny videos on utube.\""],"669":["A: I think so too. It's very popular. My kids love to watch cartoons on it."],"670":["\"I love watching DIY tutorials on Utube, very helpful for a beginner like me!\""],"671":["As a content creator on YouTube, I've come to realize that the platform's algorithm plays a significant role in determining the content's visibility and success."],"672":["\"I don't like it. Not good.\""],"673":["A: I think it's not a good idea to use my suit for this."],"674":["\"This isn't just about the villagers, it's about the people who gave me the plane.

I had never thought about the risk of injury in professional sports, but it's very true.\""],"679":["As a player, I would always think about the worst-case scenario, and for me, that's getting injured and not being able to play again."],"680":["\"I like him too\""],"681":["A: He is not in this movie."],"682":["\"I didn't know that, I loved him in 'Blade Runner'.\""],"683":["A: He often plays complex characters, doesn't he?"],"684":["\"I like to watch it sometimes.\""],"685":["A: Nice! I use same thing in my house."],"686":["\"I didn't find it very exciting, but my family liked it. Would you like to invite them over to watch it?\""],"687":["A: That's not the point, though. Even if it's just a fireplace, the scenery is really beautiful and the music is soothing."],"688":["A: Can I play?"],"689":["A: Nice to meet you."],"690":["A: Would you like to meet up this weekend?"],"691":["A: Would you like to go to the cinema tonight?"],"692":["\"I don't think so! Can't they just like, not eat the voters?\""],"693":["A: Haha, maybe! Did you know that in Brazil, some animals have their own \"animal police\" to protect them?"],"694":["\"I didn't know that! Isn't it crazy that animals have rights? If I were a voter in that forest, I'd definitely want to bring a snack!\""],"695":["That's an interesting point! If animals have constitutional rights, it raises questions about the balance between human and animal interests. I think it would be a unique challenge for the government to ensure the safety of voters while also respecting the rights of the lions."],"696":["A: Yeah, I like NBA."],"697":["A: I didn't know that! Maybe he isn't so great after all."],"698":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that. But isn't it weird that they had to give him a chance?"],"699":["That's interesting. I didn't know that. It's amazing how players' careers can take different paths, isn't it?"],"700":["\"I don't think so.\""],"701":["A: Maybe, but I didn't think it was very good."],"702":["A: Well, I didn't really understand the plot very well, but the special effects were very impressive."],"703":["To be honest, I'm not sure whether it's worth watching or not."],"704":["A: Yeah, I like Disney."],"705":["A: Yeah, maybe. But I thought it was a good movie. I didn't know it was so old!"],"706":["A: Yeah, it's very true! Companies like Hasbro and Mattel have a big influence on the story and characters. They want to make sure the toys they're going to sell are featured prominently in the movie."],"707":["That's a good point. The toymakers' influence can indeed shape the narrative and characters in a way that is not always evident to the audience. It's a delicate balance between creating a compelling story and promoting merchandise."],"708":["\"I don't like that. I want to see Gatsby's feelings.\""],"709":["A: I think so too. The movie did a good job of showing Gatsby's character."],"710":["A: Yeah, I didn't like that about Gatsby's book. It felt very one-sided."],"711":["A: That's a good point, and I think the way the film handles the parties is also a great example of symbolism, showcasing the excess and superficiality of the wealthy characters."],"712":["I like football! Can we talk about it?"],"713":["A: Cool, I didn't know that! Do you like the Super Bowl?"],"714":["Let's make Ringo's response at CEFR level B1. Here's a possible next turn:\n\nA: I didn't know that! I love watching the Premier League, it's very exciting. Don't you think it would be cool if they had a female coach?"],"715":["As the game is not only about the 11 minutes of actual play, but also about the breaks and commercial interruptions, it would not be as boring as it seems."],"716":["Can I play it again?"],"717":["A: It is a good film."],"718":["A: It was very funny wasn't it?"],"719":["As the conversation continues, A's next turn could be:\n\nA: Would you recommend it to our younger cousins?"],"720":["\"I don't like to travel far, but Canada was nice. Can you tell me more about Omaha?\""],"721":["I haven't been to Japan, but I think it would be a nice place to visit."],"722":["\"I haven't been to Japan, but I would really like to visit one day. I've heard the food is amazing.\""],"723":["That's not my first choice of holiday destination, but I've always been curious about the culture. When I was in Canada, I was surprised by how friendly the people were."],"724":["A: true that, can't play my new game on it yet"],"725":["A: interesting, didn't know that."],"726":["A: Isn't that amazing? I would definitely want one if it were available."],"727":["A: That's not true, I've heard that Apple's warranty is void if you expose their products to extreme temperatures, not just smoke."],"728":["A: Yeah, I want to see it. Can you go with me?"],"729":["A: I think it's a best movie in this year."],"730":["A: I loved the beautiful scenery and the special effects were very impressive."],"731":["As the story unfolds, the mute woman, who is a skilled healer, finds herself drawn to the amphibian creature's unique abilities and the two form a deep connection. Would you like to know more about the plot's climax?"],"732":["I like to watch horror movies. They can be very scary!"],"733":["A: I love to watch movies! My best friend and I went to the cinema last weekend and saw a new horror movie. It was really scary! Did you like any good movies recently?"],"734":["\"I love romantic comedies, haven't you seen 'When Harry Met Sally'? It's one of my all-time favorites!\""],"735":["As a matter of fact, I've been meaning to go to the cinema more often. I've heard great things about that new Marvel movie, but I'm not sure if I should watch it in 3D or not. Have you seen it?"],"736":["\"I don't like basketball.\""],"737":["A: I think so, didn't his sister play college basketball too?"],"738":["\"I didn't know that! What was his sister's name?\""],"739":["That's not fair! Even though his sister was a great player, Reggie Miller is a legend in the NBA."],"740":["A: Does Strickland want to keep that creature?"],"741":["A: Maybe she not nice to him."],"742":["\"I didn't understand, can you explain what you mean?\""],"743":["A: Would you think that having Strickland around is the best way to improve him, or does it actually make him more difficult to handle?"],"744":["\"I like Woody, not Buzz.\""],"745":["A: I think it's a nice film. Many people like it."],"746":["A: From what I've read, people loved the animation and the characters, but some didn't like the predictable storyline."],"747":["To be honest, I'm not impressed with the storyline, but I've heard the animation is quite impressive."],"748":["\"I like Michael Jackson. He is a good singer.\""],"749":["A: Did you like Michael Jackson's music?"],"750":["A: That would have been amazing! I had heard that Michael Jackson wanted to hold a concert on the moon, isn't that crazy?"],"751":["That's not true, Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury never collaborated on a duet. It's possible that you're confusing it with another artist or event."],"752":["I don't like the ones with too much action."],"753":["A: Not many people didn't like it."],"754":["\"I didn't see any very negative comments, but some people thought it was a bit slow.\""],"755":["To be honest, I thought the storyline was a bit predictable, but overall I found it engaging."],"756":["A: Yeah, I know. We must not forget her."],"757":["A: I think it's not a good thing. We should work to stop violence."],"758":["A: I didn't know that. It's very sad. I love her courage to speak out against gun violence."],"759":["As a consequence, our schools and communities should not only provide adequate security measures but also educate children about the importance of conflict resolution and peaceful coexistence."],"760":["A: Yeah, I like to laugh. Can you like, can you say \"hello, Mr. President\" in English?"],"761":["A: Nice! Did you like the first president of Zimbabwe?"],"762":["A: Did they give him a big welcome speech when he became the president?"],"763":["A: That's not true, Robert Mugabe was the first president of Zimbabwe, not Banana!"],"764":["\"I no, not me.

Not sure.\""],"769":["A: Yeah, probably."],"770":["A: Yeah, I would definitely say it's a drama.

Would they invite their loved ones to join them?\""],"775":["As the Vice President would likely have a busy schedule, I think it would be challenging for them to participate in a reality show, don't you agree?"],"776":["A: I like Meryl Streep. She was very good too."],"777":["A: She played Katherine Graham, the first female publisher of the paper."],"778":["A: She was very good too. She played Kay Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post."],"779":["To be honest, I was not impressed with her performance."],"780":["Can we watch the Super Bowl on YouTube?"],"781":["I think it's not Justin Noener's, it's Justin Timberlake. He did the half-time show."],"782":["\"I didn't know that either! It's very expensive to advertise on TV, isn't it? I think they wanted to reach a wider audience.\""],"783":["As a content partner, YouTube would not only be able to reach a massive audience during the Super Bowl, but also gain exposure for its own brand."],"784":["I like this movie! Can you like, watch it again?"],"785":["A: Nice! I think it came out in 2008.

If I had been in charge of DC back then, I would probably have wanted to hold out for a better deal."],"795":["That's a fascinating piece of trivia about the DC Comics' purchase of Superman's rights. It's amazing to think about how much the value of intellectual property has increased over the years, isn't it?"],"796":["I like Google too. Can you show me your Google account?"],"797":["A: Cool! I didn't know that. I use Google Drive too. It's very helpful for my college work."],"798":["\"I didn't know that! It's very expensive, isn't it? I would have loved to have a building named after me!\""],"799":["A: That's not the best way to save the environment, I think.

I think it would be amazing!\""],"803":["That's why I think it's amazing that they can be trained. It shows that even though they have a reputation for being fearsome, they are capable of learning and adapting to new situations."],"804":["\"I like his comedy too! He must be very good at it.\""],"805":["A: Yeah, maybe it's not a good idea to think too much, just follow your heart! Did you like his comedy show?"],"806":["\"I didn't know that!

I prefer to stay updated on my favorite shows and news through Twitter."],"816":["A: Yeah, I like Tangled better."],"817":["A: Maybe they did that because they thought it would be more popular."],"818":["A: Yeah, Tangled wasn't that popular anyway. I liked the original name better."],"819":["That's interesting. I think Disney also changed the name of Mulan from \"Mulan: The Warrior\" to just \"Mulan\" to make it more appealing to a wider audience."],"820":["I like Buzz because he is not like other toys."],"821":["A: I think so. It's not just Buzz. All the toys have their own personalities."],"822":["\"I completely agree with you. This is one of the most beautiful things about Toy Story - it shows how toys can have their own personalities and dreams, even if they're not'real'.\""],"823":["As the characters' personalities and motivations are well-developed, it's easy to become emotionally invested in their stories. The way each toy has its own unique personality, even though they're not human, makes the audience more likely to empathize with them."],"824":["Can we watch the judge's rap on YouTube?"],"825":["I think Eminem did a good job.

Sometimes I prefer to wear simple things that are comfortable."],"882":["\"I love seeing the old and the new mixed together, don't you? Like this vintage shop I saw last week that had really unique and functional designs.\""],"883":["As a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\n\"I think that's because our priorities have shifted over time. In the past, people would often prioritize durability and practicality over style, whereas now it seems like fashion has become more about making a statement.\""],"884":["A: Yeah, I like to listen to them. Can you believe it's free? Not like the TV shows now, very expensive!"],"885":["A: Nice! Did you like the latest season of House?"],"886":["A: Yeah, isn't it crazy? I didn't know Hugh Laurie was in a radio drama, but I loved him in House."],"887":["A: That's not fair! Hugh Laurie is a talented actor, but even if he didn't need the money, I'm sure he appreciated the creative challenge of playing Dr. House."],"888":["\"I like Netflix too! Can you recommend some other funny shows?\""],"889":["A: Nice! I love Monty Python, haven't seen that one in a while. Did you like the King Arthur thing?"],"890":["\"I didn't know that! I love Monty Python, haven't seen that one in a while, should give it another watch.\""],"891":["In my humble opinion, the creators of Monty Python's and the Holy Grail were not only masters of comedy, but also of clever wordplay, don't you think?"],"892":["A: Yeah, I want to go too. Can you sleep there?"],"893":["A: Maybe you can meet the president banana there!"],"894":["\"I would really like to visit the White House too, it must be an amazing experience. I've seen it on TV, isn't it huge?\""],"895":["That would be an incredible experience! I've heard the tours are really well-organized and informative, and you get to see some amazing historical artifacts."],"896":["A: Yeah, it's true."],"897":["A: Yes, it is."],"898":["A: Yeah, it's a biographical drama, isn't it?"],"899":["That's correct, it is a true story. The film is based on Michael Oher's memoir, \"I Beat the Odds: From Homelessness to the NFL\", which was co-written with Damien Fahey."],"900":["\"I like Netflix too.\""],"901":["A: I think Reed Hastings did a good job."],"902":["\"I didn't know it had that many subscribers! I love their new series, have you seen 'Stranger Things'?\""],"903":["As a consequence, I think the success of Netflix has not only revolutionized the way we consume entertainment but also forced traditional DVD rental stores to adapt to the changing market."],"904":["I like Oozma Kappa too."],"905":["A: I think so too. But I did love the way they use the monster world to make the story more interesting."],"906":["\"I didn't find Tadashi very interesting, but Taro had some funny moments.\""],"907":["To me, the best way to develop the characters would be to give them unique personalities and backstories, making them more relatable and engaging."],"908":["I don't like war movies. Can you like, not talk about that one?"],"909":["A: I didn't think it was very good."],"910":["\"I didn't like it very much, though. I thought it was a bit confusing.\""],"911":["To be honest, I didn't really enjoy Dunkirk. I found the storyline a bit confusing."],"912":["A: Yeah, I like that movie. I can't believe it's old now."],"913":["A: I didn't think it was a man's voice, but it's not a bad choice."],"914":["A: I didn't think I would, but since I saw the new one I wanted to see the old one again."],"915":["A: It's amazing how our childhood favorites can still evoke such strong memories. I used to watch that film with my siblings all the time, and Edna Mode's eccentricity was always a highlight."],"916":["A: Yeah, I want to know what Calico does. Can you tell me?"],"917":["A: Amazing! Did you know that Google's biggest search engine used to be called Backrub?"],"918":["A: Isn't it amazing how one company can be so powerful and innovative?"],"919":["That's fascinating! I didn't know that. I've always been impressed by Google's innovative approach to technology. Their ability to process vast amounts of data and provide accurate search results is truly remarkable."],"920":["I don't like it. It not my favourite."],"921":["A: Maybe, but I didn't like the latest season of Thomas the Tank Engine. The new characters are not my friend."],"922":["\"I didn't like the special effects very much, they were very predictable.\""],"923":["As a child, I was not a fan of the slow pace of the show, but I can understand why it was popular back then. Even though the animation style has changed over the years, the core of the show remains the same, and that's what keeps it appealing to new generations."],"924":["I don't know. What is fox hole radio?"],"925":["A: I think I did not know that. What is it?"],"926":["\"I didn't know that existed! I love old radio dramas. I had a feeling that I'd probably been missing out on something. Would you rather listen to a radio drama or watch a documentary?\""],"927":["As a child of the 80s, I grew up with the radio as my go-to source of entertainment. I would spend hours listening to the Top 40 countdown, trying to guess the next big hit. Even though I no longer listen to the radio as much, I still appreciate the nostalgia and the way it brings back memories of my childhood."],"928":["A: Can you tell me why Belfort does this?"],"929":["A: Did Jordan Belfort think it was a good idea to sell penny stocks?"],"930":["A: Did he make a lot of money with this company?"],"931":["As the 1980s were marked by a significant stock market crash, Belfort's career as a stockbroker was not immune to the consequences. Would you like to know more about his subsequent struggles and how he managed to turn his life around?"],"932":["\"I like them too. They're very good.\""],"933":["A: Yeah, I think they're cool."],"934":["\"I didn't know you were a fan of Air Jordans too! I love the new designs they come out with every year.\""],"935":["As a player who's been in the game for a while, I've come to appreciate the old-school style of the classic Air Jordan 1s. There's something about the way they look and feel that just can't be replicated with modern designs. Plus, they're incredibly comfortable and hold up well over time."],"936":["A: Yeah, not true! I don't like Imagine Dragons. They are not best band."],"937":["A: I didn't know that! Interesting!"],"938":["A: That's crazy! I didn't know that. I love Nevada, by the way. Have you ever been to the Hoover Dam?"],"939":["A: That's not fair, though. Imagine Dragons has some great songs, like \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\"."],"940":["\"I don't like that. Can't they be wrong?\""],"941":["A: Maybe. I didn't know that. I use IMDB."],"942":["\"I didn't know that! I thought Rotten Tomatoes was just a website giving opinions. Don't they give a lot of 100% ratings?\""],"943":["That's a well-known website, isn't it? I've seen some of their critics' reviews, and they're not easy to impress."],"944":["\"I like buses, not just for the environment, but also for the people.\""],"945":["A: Maybe, using a train would be good for the environment."],"946":["\"We would save a lot of money and time if we had efficient public transport like that. It would definitely reduce traffic congestion too.\""],"947":["As the traffic is getting increasingly congested, our public transportation system needs a major overhaul, and a commuter bus would not only reduce the number of cars on the road but also decrease air pollution."],"948":["\"I like football too! Best sport in the world!\""],"949":["A: Cool! Did you like his college days?"],"950":["\"I didn't know that either! Isn't it cool how some people have hidden talents?\""],"951":["That's really interesting! I didn't know that about Kellen Moore either. I've always been fascinated by players who have a unique skillset, like being left-handed. Do you think Mayfield's gaming background has helped him with his football career in any way?"],"952":["\"I don't know. Isn't it funny?\""],"953":["A: Maybe it's not crazy, it's just science! Did you know that some animals can even learn our words?"],"954":["\"This isn't the only strange thing I've read. I saw an article about how certain animals can't see very well in the dark because their eyes are very sensitive to light. Isn't that weird?\""],"955":["As a species, humans have always been fascinated by the mysteries of our own evolution and the evolution of other animals. It's not surprising that scientists have discovered such peculiar facts, and it's even more astonishing that these findings can be applied to our daily lives."],"956":["\"I don't like to think about it. Bears can be very strong.\""],"957":["A: Yeah, amazing things we can do! Did the paper say why the bears did that?"],"958":["\"This is very sad news. I didn't know humans would regrow a rib, isn't that amazing? I had to look it up, it's true! Would've been interesting to see if the guide would've had a chance if he had tried to run.\""],"959":["That's a good point, our bodies are capable of some amazing things. In fact, our skin regenerates itself every few weeks, it's not just our ribcage."],"960":["\"I like Superman.\""],"961":["A: Did you like it?"],"962":["A: Yeah, I didn't really like it. The plot was very confusing."],"963":["A: To be honest, I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've been meaning to. What's your take on it?"],"964":["Can we talk about the rabbit now?"],"965":["A: Cool. I didn't know that."],"966":["\"This isn't your average cop show, is it?\""],"967":["As the story unfolds, I think the rabbit's innocence and naivety will lead to a series of hilarious misunderstandings and mishaps, making it a truly entertaining comedy."],"968":["I don't like the film. Can you tell me more about it?"],"969":["A: Maybe. I like action movies."],"970":["A: I didn't know that. I'd definitely like to see it now."],"971":["As the codebreaking machine in the film is not a major plot point, I'm not particularly drawn to the movie."],"972":["I like classic American cars too."],"973":["A: Cool, I didn't know that! I love driving in old American cars, they are so big and strong."],"974":["\"I didn't know that! I love learning new things. Maybe I'll visit the Cadillac museum next time I'm in Detroit.\""],"975":["As a possible next turn of A, I would write:\n\nA: I'm glad we share the same passion for classic American cars. I've always been fascinated by the history behind their designs and the impact they had on the automotive industry."],"976":["A: Yeah, I know."],"977":["A: Yeah, I think so."],"978":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that."],"979":["A: That's not surprising, considering her long career."],"980":["A: Yeah, I like Batman! He is very brave."],"981":["A: I think so too! He is doing what he believe is best for his city."],"982":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't want to mess with him if I were a bad guy!"],"983":["As a vigilante, Batman not only takes the law into his own hands but also uses his vast resources and intellect to outsmart his enemies, making him a formidable force for justice."],"984":["A: Yeah, I like to watch tutorials on YouTube. Can you like my videos?"],"985":["A: Me too. I use it to learn English."],"986":["A: Yeah, I was just watching a funny video about cats yesterday."],"987":["That's really useful. Whenever I'm trying to figure out how to fix something around the house, I usually search for tutorials on YouTube as well."],"988":["I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND."],"989":["A: I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT FIRST. I THINK I NEED TO WATCH IT AGAIN."],"990":["A: I had to watch it twice to understand what was happening. The idea of shared dreaming is very interesting, don't you think?"],"991":["To be honest, I found the storyline quite challenging to follow at times, but the special effects and action scenes were really impressive."],"992":["\"I don't like that.\""],"993":["A: Interesting! Did you know that some cars used to have two trunks?"],"994":["\"I didn't know that! I thought it would be very heavy and expensive to have wooden trunks. Do you think it had anything to do with the price of Cadillacs being high?\""],"995":["As a consequence, I think the design of old cars was not very practical."],"996":["\"I don't like that. Can't they just delete the bad comments?\""],"997":["A: Yeah, maybe. But I prefer to think that people are not reading the comments."],"998":["\"Well, I wouldn't say it's very productive, would you? I mean, if I had all day to waste, I'd rather be doing something more useful.\""],"999":["That's a good point about the trolls. I've noticed that whenever there's a big event or a sensitive topic, the discussions can get out of hand quickly.
