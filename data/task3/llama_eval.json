That's not true."],"29":["A: Yeah, I don't think sales always mean it's the best. I mean, I like some of their songs, but I don't think they're the best."],"30":["A: Yeah, I don't think sales and popularity always mean it's the best. I mean, some of the most iconic albums are not even in the top 10 on the charts."],"31":["A: I'm not sure I agree with that assessment. I think it's unfair to judge an album's quality solely based on its commercial success. There are many great albums that didn't sell as well, but are still widely regarded as classics."],"32":["A: I think it's amazing! Google is very useful. I use it every day."],"33":["I think it's a good idea to know about the history of Google. It's amazing how much it has changed the way we live."],"34":["I think it's interesting that you mention the anti-war sentiment of 1975. I'll definitely look into it."],"35":["That's an interesting fact. I didn't know that a single Google search can be so computationally intensive.

I love playing video games, but I'm not good at racing games."],"38":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. I've played Gran Turismo before, but I'm not good at racing games."],"39":["A: That's impressive! I've heard that Gran Turismo is a very challenging game, requiring a lot of skill and patience. Did he have any experience with racing cars before playing the game?"],"40":["A: Ah, yeah! I know, right? I like watch anime on Netflix too."],"41":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I like watching anime on Netflix too. Do you have a favorite show?"],"42":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I didn't know that about the bandwidth, but it's not surprising. I mean, who doesn't love binge-watching their favorite shows or watching anime?"],"43":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that. I've been wondering, have you noticed any changes in the type of content Netflix has been offering lately? I feel like they've been focusing more on original content and less on licensed shows and movies."],"44":["A: Me too!"],"45":["A: Yeah, dogs are really smart! I read that they can even help people with disabilities."],"46":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how smart dogs are! I've heard that some dogs can even learn to recognize and respond to over 200 commands."],"47":["A: That's fascinating! It's amazing how dogs have evolved to adapt to their environments, and it's great to see cities like Istanbul taking initiatives to help stray dogs. I've also read that dogs have a unique nose print, just like human fingerprints, which can be used to identify them."],"48":["A: I know, right? He was very brave."],"49":["A: Yeah, I think it's cool that he didn't care about the rules. I would do the same if I was him."],"50":["A: Yeah, I think it's cool that he didn't care about the rules. I would do the same if I was him."],"51":["A: I can understand why they didn't want to ban him, though - he was an incredible player and his style was a huge part of his appeal."],"52":["A: I know, it's strange."],"53":["A: Yeah, it's weird! I think it's episode 12 of season 5."],"54":["A: Yeah, it's really surprising! I think it's because the writers wanted to focus on other characters for a change."],"55":["A: That's true, it's surprising that they managed to create an episode without Bart, but I think it's a testament to the show's creativity and ability to experiment with different storylines."],"56":["A: Yeah, that's crazy! I don't think so, though."],"57":["A: That's crazy! I don't think so, but maybe."],"58":["A: That's crazy! I don't think so, though. George Strait is a country music star, he's not in debt."],"59":["A: That's an interesting point, but I think the cost of living in Japan would still be much higher than in Iceland. Plus, have you considered the language barrier? It would be tough to navigate everyday life without speaking Japanese."],"60":["A: It's a happy movie. I like it."],"61":["A: It's a happy movie, yes?"],"62":["A: Yeah, it's a classic. I always feel happy when I watch it."],"63":["A: I completely agree, the music and the characters really add to the atmosphere, don't they?"],"64":["A: I like dogs.

I've read that some dogs can even detect certain diseases in humans."],"67":["A: That's fascinating! I've also read that dogs have a unique nose print, just like humans have fingerprints. It's amazing how much we can learn about their biology and behavior."],"68":["A: It's good, yes. People like it."],"69":["A: I think it's a good film. Many people like it."],"70":["A: Well, most people like it, but some think it's too childish."],"71":["A: Honestly, I'm intrigued by the mixed opinions. Some people seem to love it, while others find it too childish. I'm curious to know what you thought of it, since you've seen it."],"72":["A: I know, right? It's amazing!"],"73":["A: That's so cool! I want to go to a game and get a ball too!"],"74":["A: Yeah, it's amazing! I've heard that some teams even have special balls for special occasions, like the World Series."],"75":["A: That's amazing! I've always wondered what it would be like to catch a ball at a game. Did you keep it as a souvenir or give it to someone special?"],"76":["A: Yeah? That's cool! I like YouTube."],"77":["A: Yeah, I know. I like YouTube. It's very good."],"78":["A: Yeah, I know. But I think I would still prefer to listen to music without ads."],"79":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. I guess I'll have to reconsider my stance on YouTube Premium."],"80":["A: I like it for my family too. My little brother loves it."],"81":["A: Yeah, I think so too. My little sister loves it."],"82":["A: Yeah, I think it's great for all ages. My little sister loves watching it with me."],"83":["A: I completely agree, it's a great show that appeals to all ages. The writers do an excellent job of balancing humor and depth, making it enjoyable for both children and adults."],"84":["A: I wanna see that!"],"85":["A: That's crazy! I want to know who that player is. Can you find out his name and tell me?"],"86":["A: That's crazy! I've never heard of that before. I'll have to look it up too. Do you think it's because of the physical demands of the sport that players get traded for such low prices?"],"87":["A: That's amazing! I've always been fascinated by the stories of professional athletes who have overcome incredible challenges. I've heard that hockey players have to be extremely disciplined with their diet and training regimen to maintain their physical condition. Do you think you'll be able to find the name of that player online?"],"88":["A: Yeah, I didn't like it. The story was boring."],"89":["A: Yeah, I didn't like it. The special effects were not good."],"90":["A: Yeah, I agree. It was just an average film, nothing special."],"91":["A: Yeah, I think it's a shame because the special effects were actually quite impressive, but the storyline was quite predictable and lacked depth."],"92":["A: I like shoes too. I have many shoes."],"93":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that about Stephon Marbury. I like his shoes, they are very cheap."],"94":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that about Stephon Marbury. I think I have around 10 pairs of shoes, but I don't buy them often. I usually get them as gifts or on sale."],"95":["A: That's interesting! I've always been fascinated by the creativity behind shoe design. I've got a friend who's a shoe designer and she's always experimenting with new materials and styles."],"96":["A: Yeah! My friend's son plays on the team. He's very good."],"97":["A: Yeah, it's a big deal! My boys are really excited. We're going to the game next week."],"98":["A: Yeah, it's a big deal here! We take our football seriously. My boys are really excited about the season."],"99":["A: Yeah, it's a crazy stadium! I've been to a few games there and it's an electric atmosphere. The band plays during the pre-game warm-up and it gets the crowd pumped up."],"100":["A: I know, right?"],"101":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy. I think it's funny how we need to read all that stuff just to use something."],"102":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy how we're so used to having fast internet now. I mean, I remember when 3G was the latest thing and it was like, wow, we're so advanced! But now it's like, ancient history."],"103":["A: That's a good point. I think it's ridiculous how companies try to make those terms and conditions sound so complicated, just to avoid being held accountable. It's all about power and control, if you ask me."],"104":["A: Ah, yes! Monster University! I like animated movies."],"105":["A: Yeah, I think so too. I like animated movies."],"106":["A: Yeah, I've heard it's a funny one. I've seen it with my little sister and she loved it."],"107":["A: Yeah, I've heard great things about it. I've been meaning to watch it with my niece, she loves animated movies."],"108":["A: Yeah, that sounds good. I like movies."],"109":["A: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I like watching movies with my friends."],"110":["A: Yeah, it sounds like a great event! I've heard the Freer Gallery has a really cool atmosphere. What kind of movies do they usually show there?"],"111":["A: That sounds like a great idea! The Freer Gallery of Art has an excellent selection of films, and the discussions afterwards are always thought-provoking. Have you been to any of their previous events?"],"112":["A: That's cool! I like Eve-Online."],"113":["A: That's cool! I didn't know that."],"114":["A: That's really cool! I didn't know Eve-Online was so popular in Germany."],"115":["A: That's impressive! I've heard Eve-Online has a huge community, but I didn't know they received such a prestigious award. What do you think contributed to their success?"],"116":["A: Yeah, that's cool! I like playing basketball at the YMCA too!"],"117":["A: Yeah, that's cool! I didn't know that. I love playing basketball at the YMCA."],"118":["A: Yeah, that's really cool! I didn't know that about the YMCA. I've always loved playing basketball there with my friends."],"119":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about the YMCA. I've always been interested in the history of sports, and it's amazing how many iconic games have humble beginnings."],"120":["A: Yeah, that's him! He's very cool."],"121":["A: Yeah, that's him! He's really cool, I think he's from a different country."],"122":["A: Yeah, that's the one! He's really cool, I think he's from a new series, I'll have to check it out."],"123":["A: Yeah, that's the one! I've always been fascinated by his origin story, how he got his powers after losing his hearing."],"124":["A: Yeah, it's very nice place."],"125":["A: Yeah, it's a great message. I like that it shows we can all be friends no matter what we are."],"126":["A: Yeah, it did. And I liked how it showed that even though they're different, they can still work together and be friends."],"127":["A: Exactly! It's a great message, and I loved how it tackled some really important issues like prejudice and stereotyping."],"128":["A: I think that's crazy!"],"129":["I think we should start a petition to make a change."],"130":["I think we should focus on the issues that really matter, like education and healthcare, instead of getting distracted by these kinds of things."],"131":["\"I completely agree with you, it's frustrating to see politicians getting caught up in their own egos and distractions. In fact, I think it's a major reason why people are losing trust in the political system. We need to hold them accountable and demand more from our leaders. It's not just about changing the laws, but also about changing the culture and the way we think about politics.\""],"132":["A: I think so. I saw one in China. It's a museum."],"133":["A: Yeah, I think some are museums. I saw one in China, it's very big and very old."],"134":["A: Yeah, I think some of them are museums, like the one in Canada. And I read that the one in Germany is a conference centre."],"135":["A: That's an interesting point. I think some of them are museums, like the White House in Warsaw, Poland, which is actually a museum of Polish history. Others are used as embassies or even luxury hotels, like the White House in Beijing, China."],"136":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I didn't know that."],"137":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. I think I need to learn more about science."],"138":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that about lightning. I've always been fascinated by the weather. Do you think it's true that the sun's surface is actually cooler than its core?"],"139":["A: That's fascinating! I've also read that the sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius, which is much cooler than the core, which is a scorching 15,000,000 degrees Celsius."],"140":["A: Is it a movie about gorillas?"],"141":["A: Is it a true story?"],"142":["A: Yeah, it's about a group of intelligent gorillas."],"143":["A: I've heard it's an epic adventure film, exploring the relationship between humans and primates."],"144":["A: Hockey is very popular in Canada. Many people play it."],"145":["A: Yeah, Canada is very good at hockey. They have a lot of good players."],"146":["A: Yeah, it's true, but Canada still has a strong team. They've been playing together for a long time and have a good system."],"147":["A: Indeed, the international competition has increased, and teams like Sweden, Finland, and the Czech Republic have made significant strides in recent years."],"148":["A: Car go fast."],"149":["A: I go to school to learn more about science."],"150":["A: I see you're not familiar with biology. That's okay, it's not everyone's cup of tea. But let me try to explain it in simpler terms."],"151":["A: I understand that the topic might be complex, but I'd be happy to explain it in simpler terms. The key point is that while we share many physical characteristics with non-human apes, our brain structure and cognitive abilities are distinctively different, which is why we are classified as a separate genus."],"152":["A: Yeah, that's right!"],"153":["A: That's a lot of games!"],"154":["A: That's right! It was a couple, Ray and Pete. They did the schedule for many years."],"155":["A: That's impressive! I didn't know it was such a complex task."],"156":["A: That's crazy! I like football."],"157":["A: Yeah, that's crazy! I like Snoop Dog's music, but I don't know if I want him writing a song for my school."],"158":["A: Yeah, that's crazy! I also heard the NFL team logos on the field are really expensive, like the Patriots' logo is worth $1 million!"],"159":["A: That's quite an interesting fact about Tom Brady! I've also heard that the NFL has a strict policy regarding player conduct, so it's no surprise he's never had a strawberry. By the way, have you ever been to a live NFL game?"],"160":["A: I like ballet. It's very pretty."],"161":["A: I know, right? My little sister loves dancing when her favorite song is on."],"162":["A: And they love to move their arms and legs to the rhythm, don't they?"],"163":["A: Actually, research shows that music has a profound impact on a child's cognitive development, especially in the early years."],"164":["A: I know, it's amazing. I can use my phone to talk to my family when I'm away from home."],"165":["A: Yeah, it's amazing. I can use my phone to find information when I'm on a trip. It's very useful."],"166":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how far technology has come. I can even use my phone to translate languages when I travel abroad."],"167":["A: That's true, it's incredible how far technology has come. I've also noticed that with my new phone, I can access my bank account and pay bills online, which is really convenient."],"168":["A: That's funny! I like Scotland."],"169":["A: That's funny! I never knew that. I think it's cool that they have a law to protect it, even if it's probably just a myth."],"170":["A: That's really interesting! I didn't know that. I've always been fascinated by the Loch Ness monster, I think it would be amazing if it was real."],"171":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the legend of the Loch Ness monster. I've heard that the Scottish government's decision to protect it was largely a publicity stunt to attract tourists."],"172":["A: Good."],"173":["A: It's good."],"174":["A: It was very good, I liked the special effects."],"175":["A: I thought it was quite entertaining, but the plot was a bit predictable."],"176":["A: He's very famous, yes. Many people like him."],"177":["A: Yeah, social media is big business now. Many people make a lot of money from it."],"178":["A: Yeah, social media is a big deal now. Many people are making a lot of money from it. I know some YouTubers who have millions of subscribers and earn a lot from ads."],"179":["A: That's fascinating! It's amazing how social media has become a lucrative platform for celebrities to monetize their fame. I've noticed that many influencers are now leveraging their online presence to promote products and services, and it seems to be a very effective way to earn a living."],"180":["A: It's very big, yes?"],"181":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know it was so successful."],"182":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know it was so successful."],"183":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know it was initially exclusive to Harvard students. I've heard that the founder's vision was to make it a platform for everyone, not just the elite."],"184":["A: Ha ha, yeah, I know what you mean! I like cats because they are easy to take care of."],"185":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I once saw a cat eating a bird in my backyard. It was very fast!"],"186":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I once tried some street food in Tokyo and it was a big mistake. The vendor didn't speak English and I didn't know what I was eating. But at least it was an adventure!"],"187":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about dogs' color vision. It's interesting how our perception of the world can be so different from that of other species."],"188":["A: Ah, yes! I like CS Lewis too!"],"189":["A: Ah, yes, I know who Anne Jones is! She's very fast, isn't she?"],"190":["A: Ah, that's amazing! I've never heard of her before. What's her secret to reading so fast?"],"191":["A: That's impressive! I've always been fascinated by people who can read quickly and efficiently. I've tried to improve my reading speed, but I'm afraid I'm not as skilled as Anne Jones."],"192":["A: Yeah, it's amazing!"],"193":["A: Yeah, it's amazing! I remember my grandma had a big TV and we would watch Sesame Street together."],"194":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how technology has changed everything. I remember when I was a kid, we didn't even have mobile phones!"],"195":["A: That's true, technology has come a long way, hasn't it? I mean, who would have thought that a small appearance on Sesame Street could lead to a successful career, and now with the internet, anyone can potentially become a celebrity with just a few clicks."],"196":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I wish I had known about it!"],"197":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I'm surprised I didn't hear about it earlier. Do you think it's a good idea to unfriend people just for a free burger?"],"198":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I'm surprised I didn't hear about it earlier. I think it was a pretty clever marketing idea."],"199":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I've been thinking of doing a Facebook detox, but it's hard to resist the temptation of staying connected with friends and family. Plus, I've got some online groups that I'm really interested in, so it's hard to give it up completely."],"200":["A: I like listen to music on the radio."],"201":["A: I think it's cool that we can hear things from far away, like the radio storms on Jupiter."],"202":["A: Yeah, I can imagine it's really cool to listen to the radio storms on Jupiter. I've always been fascinated by space and the universe."],"203":["A: I completely agree, it's fascinating to think about how technology has evolved, and it's amazing that we can still tune into Jupiter's radio storms today."],"204":["A: I like it too!"],"205":["A: I like the book too. It's a classic."],"206":["A: I think you'll really enjoy the film. The way they adapted the book is really good."],"207":["A: I completely understand why you're excited, it's a classic novel and the film adaptation is really well-done. The way Baz Luhrmann brought the 1920s setting to life was impressive."],"208":["A: Yeah, that's true!"],"209":["A: Yeah, that's true! Naismith was a physical education teacher, so he knew what kids liked."],"210":["A: Yeah, that's a good point. Naismith was a physical education teacher, so he probably designed the game to be easy to learn and play."],"211":["A: That's an interesting point, and it's true that Naismith's Midwestern background might have influenced the development of the game. In fact, the first game of basketball was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets, which were hung ten feet high."],"212":["A: That's good. I will try to use my phone less."],"213":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. I think I'll try to use my phone less tomorrow."],"214":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that about Unicef. I think I'll try to use my phone less tomorrow."],"215":["A: That's amazing! I had no idea about Unicef's initiative. It's a great way to raise awareness about the importance of access to clean water. I'll definitely make sure to turn off my phone for a minute or two today."],"216":["A: Yeah, it's very violent."],"217":["A: Yeah, it's very violent."],"218":["A: Yeah, it's a bit too violent for my taste."],"219":["A: Yeah, the violence is quite intense, isn't it? I think it's the constant tension and suspense that makes it so thrilling, though."],"220":["A: Yes, I like detective comics."],"221":["A: Yeah, I like detective comics too. Sherlock Holmes is my favorite."],"222":["A: Yeah, I like detective comics too. I think Sherlock Holmes is really cool."],"223":["A: Yes, I do! I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes.

It's amazing what people can do with simple things."],"226":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how technology can be used in different ways, even in unexpected situations."],"227":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been interested in the way technology can be used in creative ways, like the soldiers' makeshift radio. It's amazing how something as simple as a razor blade and a pencil can be used to receive signals from far away."],"228":["A: They are very good. They are the best team in the world."],"229":["A: Yeah, I think they're pretty good. They won the World Cup a few years ago."],"230":["A: Yeah, I've heard they're really good. They've won the World Cup a few times, haven't they?"],"231":["A: That's a great point about the shot, and I think you're right that once others can do it, it loses its significance. As for the New Zealand team, I've heard they're actually quite skilled in both basketball and rugby, so it's not just a height advantage that's giving them an edge."],"232":["A: I like ballet too. My sister took it when she was little. She was very good."],"233":["A: Yeah, I can imagine! It's cool that your daughter liked ballet. Did she like the costumes and the music too?"],"234":["A: Yeah, I can imagine that was quite a sight! I've always thought that dance and martial arts share some similarities, like the importance of coordination and rhythm."],"235":["Here is a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\n\"I can see why your daughter would enjoy ballet, it's a great way to develop coordination and discipline. In fact, many professional dancers, including those in Bollywood, start training at a young age. It's interesting to think about how different dance styles, like ballet and martial arts, share common elements, such as the importance of control and fluid movement.\""],"236":["A: I like Buzz. He is funny."],"237":["A: I like the toys, but I don't know why they fight."],"238":["A: I think I was Team Buzz, but I was really young when I saw it."],"239":["A: I'm surprised I didn't notice the director's influence on the storyline, it's quite evident now that I've seen the rest of the trilogy."],"240":["A: I know, it's very popular in America. I like play it with my friends."],"241":["A: I think it's funny that some countries don't like it. I like playing it with my friends."],"242":["A: Yeah, I can see why. The game is really popular in the US, but I've never thought about it being banned in other countries."],"243":["A: That's fascinating! I can understand why it would be seen as a threat to certain governments. The game's emphasis on individualism and competition might be at odds with some socialist ideologies."],"244":["A: Yeah, okay."],"245":["A: Yeah, let's do that. I'm not really interested in reading about Thor anyway."],"246":["A: Yeah, let's do that. I'm curious to see what's in the next one."],"247":["A: I think it's interesting how Loki's character adds a layer of complexity to the story. His mischievous nature creates a sense of unpredictability, which makes the plot more engaging."],"248":["A: Ah, okay. So Gronk didn't play with Brady for a long time."],"249":["A: Ah, okay, so he didn't have Gronk in 2007."],"250":["A: Ah, so he didn't have Gronk until his third season with the Patriots."],"251":["A: Ah, so he didn't have Gronk for the first few years of his career, then."],"252":["A: Yeah, it's a good movie."],"253":["A: Yeah, it's a good movie. I think it's very funny."],"254":["A: Yeah, it's a really good movie. The actor who plays Jordan Belfort, Leonardo DiCaprio, won an Oscar for his performance."],"255":["A: Yeah, it's a really thought-provoking film that raises questions about the ethics of high finance and the consequences of one's actions. The performances by the actors, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, are also outstanding."],"256":["A: Ah, that's cool! I like learning new things."],"257":["A: That's a good point! I never knew that. I think I will look into that sound frequency and see if it's used in horror movies."],"258":["A: That's a good point about the area code! I never knew that. I wonder if the sound frequency that scares humans is used in any horror movies."],"259":["A: That's an interesting fact! I never knew that. I wonder if the sound frequency that scares humans is used in any horror movies or soundtracks."],"260":["A: I like pandas! They are cute!"],"261":["A: I like that idea! I would love to help pandas.

I thought it was just a fairy tale."],"266":["A: Yeah, I didn't know that. I thought it was just a fairy tale."],"267":["A: That's true, but I think it's more than just dark fantasy.

My favorite is the robin."],"278":["I like birds too. My favorite is the blue jay. They're very common in Chicago."],"279":["That's fascinating! I've always been interested in ornithology.

I like how they kept the main storylines the same."],"287":["A: I completely agree, the film did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the novel."],"288":["A: Yeah, it was very strange. I think it was because of the Sony hack."],"289":["A: Yeah, it was very strange. I think it was because of the Sony hack."],"290":["A: Yeah, it was really strange. I think it was because of the controversy surrounding the movie."],"291":["A: Yeah, it was a real conspiracy theory, and I think it's still a bit of a mystery what really happened. The whole thing was just so bizarre, from the hacking to the Sony emails being leaked. It's crazy to think about how much of an impact it had on the film industry."],"292":["A: Yeah, Tolkien was a big fan of languages!"],"293":["A: Yeah, J.R.R. Tolkien was a big fan of languages and mythology. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon studies."],"294":["A: Yeah, J.R.R. Tolkien was a big fan of languages and mythology. He even created his own Elvish languages!"],"295":["A: That's fascinating! The Javanese alphabet is indeed a unique and fascinating aspect of the language.

They are very good."],"305":["A: I like his songs. They are very good."],"306":["A: Yeah, his lyrics were really powerful and still relevant today. I think that's why his music is so popular even after all these years."],"307":["A: That's really impressive, I didn't realize his music had such a significant impact.

I'm more of a morning person myself, I usually watch Netflix during my daily commute to work, which is around 7-9 am."],"316":["A: Me too!"],"317":["A: Yeah, it's really cool! I'm glad we talked about it."],"318":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how technology has improved reading for everyone, including those with disabilities."],"319":["A: I completely agree, it's amazing how technology has advanced to the point where people with disabilities can have equal access to information."],"320":["A: I don't like it. It's not funny."],"321":["A: I think it's a funny movie, but maybe not as funny as his other ones."],"322":["A: Yeah, I think it's unfair to judge a movie based on a website's rating. I liked it, so it's okay in my book!"],"323":["A: I completely agree with you, it's all about personal taste, and I think the film's unique blend of humor and social commentary is what makes it stand out from his other works."],"324":["A: He is very good at his job."],"325":["A: Yeah, I don't like her show either. She is very mean to people."],"326":["A: Yeah, I agree with you. I don't like her show either. She's always yelling at people and being mean."],"327":["A: That's really impressive about Lebron's business acumen. His ability to negotiate such a significant increase in salary is a testament to his confidence and strategic thinking."],"328":["A: That's interesting!"],"329":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that."],"330":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. I guess being a president is a good way to get rich."],"331":["A: That's an interesting fact! I didn't know that. I suppose it's no surprise, given the tumultuous times they lived in and the significant roles they played in shaping the country's economy."],"332":["A: Oh, yeah! I know that song! It's very good!"],"333":["A: Oh, yeah! I know that song! It's very good!"],"334":["A: Ah, yes! I know that song! It's really catchy. I've heard it on the radio many times."],"335":["A: Ah, I think I have heard that song, it's a classic! I've always been fascinated by the history of rock music, and it's amazing to think about how some of these iconic bands have been around for decades."],"336":["A: He is very good!"],"337":["A: He is very good in many movies."],"338":["A: I know, he's been acting for a long time, hasn't he?"],"339":["A: I'm sure his performances in the 80s were particularly iconic, don't you agree?"],"340":["A: That's cool! I like dance too."],"341":["A: That's cool! I like hip-hop dance. Do you like it too?"],"342":["A: That's really cool! I didn't know that about Tupac. What kind of dance did he like best?"],"343":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about Tupac. What kind of ballet did he perform?"],"344":["A: Yeah, it's true."],"345":["A: Yeah, it's true. My friend's brother plays for the US team. He was born in England but his mom is American."],"346":["A: Yeah, it's interesting to see how the rules work. I think it's good that the US Women's team has done well, it gives them more recognition and maybe more opportunities to play professionally."],"347":["A: That's an interesting point about the dual nationality, and it's indeed a complex issue. I think it's also worth noting that the US has a relatively small pool of talented players to draw from, which can make it harder for the men's team to compete with other countries that have a larger population and more established soccer cultures."],"348":["A: yes i watch movie sometimes"],"349":["A: yes i watch movies sometimes"],"350":["A: Yeah, I watch movies sometimes."],"351":["A: Yeah, I do. In fact, I try to watch at least one movie every week."],"352":["A: She's a great actress!"],"353":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It was really nice to see that."],"354":["I think it's great that they showed the importance of communication in the film. It's not just about speaking, but also about understanding each other."],"355":["I think it's great that the film tackled such a sensitive topic in a respectful manner. The way they portrayed the relationship between the two characters was really touching."],"356":["A: Eminem is very good. I like his songs."],"357":["A: I like Eminem's music. He is very good at rapping."],"358":["A: Yeah, I think it's cool that he followed his passion. I've always liked his music, especially \"Lose Yourself\"."],"359":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been a fan of his lyrics, and it's amazing how he was able to channel his creative energy into music."],"360":["A: That's very interesting! I like playing Minecraft."],"361":["A: That's really cool! I like playing Minecraft too."],"362":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean, it's amazing what people can create with Minecraft, but I'm not sure I'd trust a computer made of building blocks with my personal data."],"363":["A: It's indeed astonishing how creative people can be, and I'm curious to know what kind of features this 16-bit computer would have, considering it was built with Minecraft blocks."],"364":["A: That's true."],"365":["A: That's true, it's not easy to be close to the wolves when they are giving birth."],"366":["A: Yeah, it's amazing what they did. They must have been very careful with the wolf pups."],"367":["A: It's indeed remarkable that they were willing to take such risks and immerse themselves in the wolves' natural habitat."],"368":["A: Yeah, I like drama. I watch TV sometimes."],"369":["A: Yeah, I like drama. I watched House MD. It's a good show."],"370":["A: Yeah, I love that show! The main character, Dr. House, is really funny."],"371":["A: Actually, I'm more into comedy. I find it's a great way to relax after a long day. Have you seen any good comedies lately?"],"372":["A: Ah, ahaha, that's so cool! I didn't know that!"],"373":["A: That's cool! I didn't know that. I like their clothes, too."],"374":["A: That's really interesting! I didn't know that. I think it's clever how they use the alligator logo now."],"375":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. It's interesting how companies often use their founders' names or nicknames to create a brand identity."],"376":["A: I like radio, it's simple."],"377":["A: I don't know, I'm not sure I want to give up my radio. I like listening to the news and music on the radio."],"378":["A: That's interesting, I didn't know that. I might give it a try. But I still prefer the radio because it's more relaxing, you know, no distractions like with a phone."],"379":["A: That's an interesting point, I never thought about using my phone to listen to the radio. I'm not sure I'd want to give up my traditional radio, but it's good to know that I have the option."],"380":["A: Yes, I see it yesterday."],"381":["A: No, I haven't. Is it good?"],"382":["A: Ah, no, I haven't seen it yet. Is it a good film?"],"383":["A: Actually, I haven't had a chance to see it yet, but I've heard it's a really interesting film. What did you think of it?"],"384":["A: I like the actor who plays the bad guy. He is very good."],"385":["A: Yeah, I liked the special effects. They were really cool!"],"386":["A: Yeah, I liked the special effects, they were really cool."],"387":["A: Honestly, I think the plot was a bit predictable, but the acting was superb, especially from the lead actress."],"388":["A: What happened on November 11, 2011?"],"389":["A: Oh no, what happened?"],"390":["A: That's interesting, what happened on that day?"],"391":["A: That's interesting, I hadn't heard about that incident. What happened exactly?"],"392":["A: My friend has a dog, it is very smart."],"393":["A: Yeah, many people think that, but it's not true."],"394":["A: Yeah, it's a common misconception."],"395":["A: That's a common misconception, and it's interesting to learn about the differences in perception between species."],"396":["A: They play!"],"397":["A: They have adventures!"],"398":["A: They have a lot of adventures! They play games, have a tea party, and even have a little army battle."],"399":["A: When Andy is away, the toys come to life and have their own adventures. They have a special leader, Woody, who is a pull-string cowboy toy. He's very brave and responsible, and he always tries to keep the other toys out of trouble."],"400":["A: Yeah, I go there one time. It's big building!"],"401":["A: Yeah, I go there sometimes. It's really cool."],"402":["A: Yeah, I've been there once. It's a pretty cool place. They have a big store and a museum with all the NBA championships and jerseys."],"403":["A: Actually, I've been there a few times for business meetings, and it's an impressive facility. The attention to detail and the history on display are really fascinating."],"404":["A: He is a funny guy. I like watch him on TV."],"405":["A: That's cool! I like watching his show."],"406":["A: That's really cool! I didn't know that. I think it's because Americans used to play rugby and association football, and they just shortened the name to soccer."],"407":["A: That's really cool! I didn't know that. I've always been fascinated by the origins of language and how certain words or phrases become popular. It's amazing how \"soccer\" has become a widely accepted term in the US, despite the rest of the world calling it \"football\"."],"408":["I think it's strange."],"409":["I think it's strange."],"410":["I think it's strange that the Saints have such a rule. Maybe it's because they want to keep the players and cheerleaders in different groups."],"411":["I think it's interesting that the Saints have such a strict policy. It's not just about the cheerleaders, but also about the players' focus on their performance."],"412":["A: I like the actors in it."],"413":["A: Yeah, I like the special effects, they were really cool."],"414":["A: Yeah, I think the critics were a bit harsh, it's not that bad."],"415":["A: It's interesting to see how critics and audiences have different opinions on the same film, don't you think?"],"416":["A: Yeah, Eminem was in 8 Mile. I think he won an Oscar for that movie."],"417":["A: Yeah, there's a Golden Globe for TV shows."],"418":["A: Yeah, there's the Emmy Awards for TV shows. But Eminem's music career is actually more successful than his acting career. He's sold millions of albums worldwide."],"419":["A: Ah, yes, 8 Mile was a great film! As for TV shows, there are several awards that recognize excellence in television programming. The Emmy Awards are one of the most prestigious ones, and they have been presented annually since 1949."],"420":["A: Bruce like dance, yes?"],"421":["A: Yeah, I know! I saw a video of him dancing ballet once. He was really good!"],"422":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how many famous people have taken ballet classes. I think even some professional athletes have done it to improve their flexibility."],"423":["A: That's amazing! I've heard that ballet requires a lot of discipline and dedication. I'm sure Bruce would have had to work hard to master the techniques."],"424":["A: He is very good at many things."],"425":["A: That's interesting. He also knows many important people."],"426":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that."],"427":["A: That's interesting. I've also heard that the congressman's security is quite tight, with multiple layers of protection."],"428":["A: He look good!"],"429":["A: He look funny!"],"430":["A: That's what made him so cool!"],"431":["A: That added a lot of personality to his character, don't you think?"],"432":["A: Ah, wow! That's crazy!"],"433":["A: That's crazy! I love his poem. I like the part where he says \"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'\"."],"434":["A: That's crazy! I didn't know that. I guess you can't always judge a book by its cover, right?"],"435":["A: That's nothing! I heard that Mozart was paid only a few dollars for his symphonies. It's crazy how some artists have to struggle to get recognition."],"436":["A: She is very smart, yes?"],"437":["A: She was a true pioneer. Her discoveries were very important."],"438":["A: That's great to know. Her work on circuits and chips must have been very important."],"439":["A: Indeed, it's essential to highlight the contributions of women in science, as they often face unique challenges and biases."],"440":["A: Ah, Jason Segel, I like him! Is he funny in the movie?"],"441":["A: Ah, I like Jason Segel. He is funny. Is the movie funny too?"],"442":["A: Ah, I've heard of Jason Segel, he's a funny guy. What's the movie called again?"],"443":["A: Ah, I've heard of Jason Segel, he's a talented actor. What's the storyline like? Is it a typical superhero movie or is there something more unique about it?"],"444":["A: Yes, I have been. It's very nice."],"445":["A: No, I haven't. I don't think I would like it."],"446":["A: Yeah, I've been to Napa Valley once. It was really nice, but I didn't drink too much wine because of my headaches."],"447":["A: Actually, I've been to Napa Valley a few times, and it's really impressive. The scenery is stunning, and the wine tastings are very informative."],"448":["A: I like Harry Potter. I want to read book one."],"449":["A: I like magic, so I think I would like Harry Potter."],"450":["I think it's interesting that the military values reading so much. It shows that they understand the importance of knowledge and imagination."],"451":["A: I'm intrigued by the idea of Quidditch, it sounds like a unique and imaginative game. I've heard that J.K. Rowling drew inspiration from various sports and mythologies to create it."],"452":["A: Yeah, me neither."],"453":["A: Yeah, I like superhero movies too!"],"454":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm not a huge fan of superheroes either, but this one seems different."],"455":["A: Yeah, I've heard the special effects are really impressive, but I'm not sure if it's my cup of tea either."],"456":["A: I like football. It's exciting."],"457":["I like football. It's a good game."],"458":["I'd rather be an engineer. At least the money is stable and secure. Plus, I don't like the physical demands of football."],"459":["Here's a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I think I'd choose football. The thrill of playing in front of thousands of fans and the sense of achievement when you win a championship would be incredible.

Do you have a favorite artist or band that you always come back to?"],"471":["Here is a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\nA: I've been meaning to explore more genres, like electronic and indie music. Have you heard of any good artists in those categories?"],"472":["A: I like horses. They are very strong."],"473":["A: I know, right? They are very smart animals."],"474":["A: That's really interesting! I didn't know that about Icelandic horses. I've always wanted to visit Iceland to see them in person."],"475":["A: That's fascinating indeed! The unique characteristics of Icelandic horses, such as their fifth gear, are a result of their isolation and adaptation to the harsh Icelandic climate over thousands of years."],"476":["A: Yes, I like it."],"477":["A: Yeah, I think it's a great movie."],"478":["A: Yeah, I think the director did a great job in balancing the fantasy and reality in the movie."],"479":["\"I think the film's ability to balance its grand visuals with a deep emotional core is what makes it truly exceptional. The cinematography is indeed breathtaking, but it's the way the story explores the characters' inner struggles that really resonates with me.\""],"480":["A: I like animals. I have a dog."],"481":["A: I like animals, yes. I have a pet dog."],"482":["A: Yeah, I've always been fascinated by animals, but I don't think I'm good enough at science to be a zoologist. I just like learning about them in my free time."],"483":["A: Actually, I've always been fascinated by the way animals adapt to their environments, and I've been considering pursuing a master's degree in wildlife conservation to learn more about it."],"484":["A: I know, right? The special effects were amazing!"],"485":["A: I know, right? The special effects were really good."],"486":["I think the film's portrayal of the characters is also well-done. The way they show the complexity of their personalities is really interesting."],"487":["Here is a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\nA: I'm surprised that the film didn't receive a higher rating, considering the positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The way the director handled the themes of identity and social class was particularly noteworthy."],"488":["A: Yeah, I like Jordan too. He's a good leader."],"489":["A: Yeah, I like Jordan too. He's a good leader."],"490":["A: Yeah, I remember that. I think it's interesting how politicians can say things like that and still get away with it."],"491":["A: That's an interesting fact! I didn't know that about the gavel. I've always been fascinated by the history of the US Senate, especially the way it's evolved over time."],"492":["A: Me too!"],"493":["A: Wow! I like Bruce Lee. He is very strong."],"494":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. I love watching dance competitions on TV."],"495":["A: That's amazing! I've always been a fan of his movies."],"496":["A: Yeah, that's true! In my country, we have to play 30% of the music by local artists."],"497":["A: Yeah, that's true! In my country, we have a similar rule. We have to play a certain percentage of local music too."],"498":["A: Yeah, that's true! I didn't know that about Canada. In my country, we have a similar rule, but it's not as strict. We have to play a certain percentage of local music, but it's not 40%."],"499":["A: Ah, that's a good point! I didn't know that about Canada. It's fascinating how different countries have their own unique regulations and cultural influences on music. By the way, have you ever noticed how some songs become super popular in certain regions, but not as well-known elsewhere?"],"500":["A: Yeah, it's very useful. I use it every day."],"501":["A: Yeah, it's true. My friend's brother is addicted to playing games online. He plays for hours every day."],"502":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how it's changed our lives. I remember when we didn't have it, it was like a different world."],"503":["A: That's true, it's amazing how it has changed the way we live and communicate.

Trump better."],"517":["A: He's a funny guy, but I don't think he's serious about running."],"518":["A: That's really surprising. I didn't know he was running. I think it's weird that he pretends to be something he's not. Does he have a chance of winning?"],"519":["A: That's quite an interesting strategy, trying to appeal to a specific demographic by pretending to be one of them. I'm not sure if it will work, though. It's not the first time someone has tried to manipulate people's emotions with divisive rhetoric."],"520":["A: Yeah, I like him. He's good player."],"521":["A: Yeah, I like him. He's a good player."],"522":["A: Yeah, I've heard he's a great player. I like how he's always talking about the importance of hard work and dedication."],"523":["A: That's fascinating!

My friend's dad is a republican and he has a beard."],"534":["A: That's a funny fact! I didn't know that. Do you think Google's IPO had a big impact on the company's growth?"],"535":["A: That's a fascinating fact! I didn't know that.

I like their food."],"537":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan once. It's a really cool country. I liked the food and the cities were very clean."],"538":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan once. It was a really cool experience. I was surprised to see how efficient their public transportation system is."],"539":["A: That's interesting about Nevada, I've heard that the government uses a significant portion of that land for military testing and training purposes. I've also read that Rhode Island's small size makes it challenging for the government to find suitable land to purchase or lease, which might explain why they own less land compared to other states."],"540":["A: Yes, I hear it on TV."],"541":["A: Yeah, I heard about that. It's crazy!"],"542":["A: Yeah, I heard about that! It's crazy, right? I mean, who would steal the crown jewels?"],"543":["A: Yes, I did hear about it. It's absolutely astonishing that they managed to steal such a valuable and iconic treasure."],"544":["A: Yeah, it's weird!"],"545":["A: Yeah, it's weird to think about."],"546":["A: Yeah, it's crazy to think about! I mean, can you imagine having to read out loud all the time? It would be so awkward!"],"547":["A: Yeah, it's quite astonishing to think about how reading habits have evolved over time. In the past, reading was a more communal activity, and people would often read aloud to each other or to themselves in a loud voice."],"548":["A: Yeah, maybe."],"549":["A: Yeah, maybe, but I think it's not good to lie, it's not honest."],"550":["A: Yeah, it's funny how some people can get away with things, but eventually, the truth comes out and they look silly."],"551":["A: That's a good point, but I think it's also important to consider the psychological aspect of it. People often get caught up in the excitement of a deal and don't think clearly, so they might not even realize they're being scammed until it's too late."],"552":["A: Yeah, that's crazy!"],"553":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how things can turn out. Sometimes, people become famous for the wrong reasons."],"554":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how life can take unexpected turns. Sometimes, people become famous for reasons that have nothing to do with their actual talent."],"555":["A: Indeed, it's fascinating to think about how people's careers can take unexpected turns, often due to a combination of factors, including timing, luck, and a bit of creativity."],"556":["A: He did good job."],"557":["A: He did what was right, yeah?"],"558":["A: Yeah, I think Donnie did the right thing, even if it was a tough decision."],"559":["A: Despite his initial setback, Jordan's determination to clear his name only grew stronger."],"560":["A: I know, right?"],"561":["A: I know, right? It's a really good movie!"],"562":["A: I know, right? It's amazing how well it's held up over time."],"563":["A: I completely agree, the special effects were also quite impressive for its time, considering it was made over two decades ago."],"564":["A: Yes, it is old. But it's still a good movie."],"565":["A: Yes, it's an old movie, but it's still very good. I like the way the director, Steven Spielberg, told the story."],"566":["A: Yeah, it's over 40 years old now, but its influence is still felt in the film industry."],"567":["A: Yes, it's over 40 years old now, but its influence can still be seen in many modern blockbusters. In fact, the film's use of practical effects, such as the iconic shark prop, has become a benchmark for many filmmakers."],"568":["A: I think Clint Eastwood is a good director. He makes good movies."],"569":["A: I think Clint Eastwood is a good director, he makes good movies."],"570":["A: Yeah, he's a big fan of jazz and it's cool that he includes it in his movies."],"571":["A: That's true, Clint Eastwood is a big fan of jazz and he often incorporates it into his films. In fact, he even released a jazz album himself, \"Play \"The Theme from 'Myst\u00e8re'\"\", which is a cover of a jazz standard."],"572":["A: That's true."],"573":["A: Yeah, it's amazing. I think it's because it's a classic."],"574":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how some albums stay popular over time. I think it's because their music is timeless."],"575":["A: That's true, but it's a testament to the album's timeless appeal."],"576":["A: I like Captain America. He is strong."],"577":["A: Me too!"],"578":["A: Yeah, I think the Avengers are a great team."],"579":["A: I completely agree, I think the Avengers team has a great dynamic, and each character brings their own unique personality to the table."],"580":["A: I like action movies."],"581":["A: I like action movies, they are my favorite."],"582":["A: Yeah, the special effects were cool, but the storyline was kinda weak, don't you think?"],"583":["A: Honestly, I was blown away by the storyline, it was so engaging and unpredictable."],"584":["A: Me no like big birds too. They make me scared."],"585":["A: Yeah, nature can be very strange. I like animals that are cute and small, like rabbits and dogs. They are friendly and easy to understand."],"586":["A: Yeah, nature can be pretty wild! I'd rather not think about it too much, to be honest. But it's good to know some interesting facts, like about crocodiles and birds. Maybe I'll just stick to learning about them instead of snakes!"],"587":["A: That's terrifying! I'd rather face a swarm of snakes than encounter those mysterious creatures. Australia's got its own unique set of dangers, I suppose. I've always been fascinated by the country's unique wildlife, though. Have you ever heard of the platypus? It's one of the most bizarre creatures I've ever read about."],"588":["A: Me too."],"589":["A: Me too."],"590":["A: I'm the same, I would be very angry if someone hurt my dog."],"591":["A: I completely understand, I would feel the same way if someone harmed my own pet."],"592":["A: Me too! I never read the terms."],"593":["A: That's crazy! I never read the terms and conditions. I just click \"agree\" and hope for the best!"],"594":["A: That's crazy! I never read the terms and conditions either. I just click \"agree\" and hope for the best!"],"595":["A: That's really surprising! I guess people are just too busy clicking \"agree\" without reading the fine print."],"596":["A: Ah, yes! I like movie."],"597":["A: Ah, yes! I like this movie. The actors are very good."],"598":["A: Ah, yes, I've seen it! It's a great film, isn't it?"],"599":["A: Yes, I've seen it, it's a powerful film that highlights the importance of freedom of the press, don't you think?"],"600":["A: I like horror movies. They are scary."],"601":["A: Yeah, I like watching horror movies. They're very exciting!"],"602":["A: Yeah, I guess that's true. But I still don't like watching scary movies. They give me nightmares."],"603":["A: That's an interesting point, but I think the thrill and suspense of horror movies can actually increase my heart rate and blood pressure, making it a more intense experience than a workout."],"604":["A: I like this film too. It's very good."],"605":["A: I like this film because it's based on a true story."],"606":["A: I completely agree with you, it's a really well-made film. The way it shows Mark Zuckerberg's life is very realistic and engaging."],"607":["A: I completely agree with you, the way the film explores the themes of social media, ambition, and friendship is really thought-provoking."],"608":["A: I like Keanu. He's a good actor."],"609":["A: Yeah, I like him. He's a good actor."],"610":["A: Yeah, I really liked him in The Matrix."],"611":["A: I've heard he's a great actor, so that's definitely a bonus."],"612":["A: He is bad because he is mean to Elsa."],"613":["A: He is bad because he is mean to Elsa."],"614":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. I think Hans is a bad guy because he's very manipulative and uses people to get what he wants. He pretended to be in love with Anna to get to the throne."],"615":["A: That's interesting. It seems that Hans's motivations are driven by his family's interests and his own ambition, rather than any genuine feelings for Anna. His father's influence likely played a significant role in shaping his character."],"616":["A: yes, i like horror movies."],"617":["A: yeah, i like some horror movies. the exorcist is my favourite."],"618":["A: Yeah, I do! I love horror movies, especially the ones with a lot of suspense."],"619":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of the horror genre, but I think what makes this movie stand out is the way it's based on real events."],"620":["A: Sorry. I'm here now."],"621":["A: Sorry about that. I'm here now. Can we start the conversation?"],"622":["A: Sorry to hear that. I'll try to hurry up and finish reading the page. Can you please give me a minute?"],"623":["A: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I'm still here, and I'm happy to continue the conversation. Can you please tell me a bit more about what you're interested in discussing or what you'd like to talk about?"],"624":["A: I think so. My kids like watching those videos too."],"625":["A: Yeah, it's very hard to be famous on YouTube. You need to be very good at something and have a lot of time to make good videos."],"626":["A: Yeah, it's really hard to stand out. My kids are trying to make funny videos, but it's not easy to be funny all the time."],"627":["A: That's true, the competition is fierce, and you need to have a unique idea or a lot of creativity to stand out from the crowd."],"628":["A: I go now."],"629":["A: Yeah, I think so. I don't want to be in a place where I can't breathe well."],"630":["A: Yeah, I think it's weird too. I mean, who knows what kind of problems that would cause."],"631":["A: I completely agree with you, it's essential to be aware of the surroundings and take responsibility for one's actions."],"632":["A: That's true. What happened to the Hindenburg?"],"633":["A: That's true. I think it was the hydrogen gas that caused the problem."],"634":["A: Yeah, I think it was a big mistake to use hydrogen."],"635":["A: That's true, the Hindenburg's biggest problem was the hydrogen gas that it used, which was highly flammable."],"636":["A: Yes, I like \"The Other Guys\"."],"637":["A: Yeah, I like the second one too. It's funny."],"638":["A: Yeah, I've seen a few. I really liked \"Date Night\" with Steve Carell and Tina Fey."],"639":["A: Yeah, I've seen a few. I really enjoyed \"The Big Short\" from 2015, it's a great documentary-style comedy about the financial crisis."],"640":["A: Yeah, I know, right?"],"641":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's not common to see a movie with such good reviews."],"642":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. It's not often you see a movie with such high ratings and great reviews."],"643":["A: Indeed, it's quite unusual to see a film with such a high rating and critical acclaim, especially in this era of instant gratification and fleeting attention spans."],"644":["A: Ah, that's funny! I like Lorde's song."],"645":["A: Ah, that's interesting! I didn't know that. I like Lorde's music."],"646":["A: Ah, that's interesting! I didn't know that. I think it's weird to ban a song just because of a sports team."],"647":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. I think it's understandable that the radio stations would ban the song, though. It's not every day that a team from the same city is playing against the team in the World Series. It's a bit awkward to have a song by the opposing team's city playing on the radio during such a big event."],"648":["A: I like Cardi B, she's very good. I read a book last week. It was about a boy who had a dog."],"649":["A: Yeah, I read a book about hip-hop history. It was really interesting."],"650":["A: Yeah, I read a book about the history of hip-hop. It was really interesting to learn about how it all started and how it's evolved over time."],"651":["I've been meaning to get into more contemporary literature, but I've been stuck on this one novel by Haruki Murakami that I just can't put down. His writing style is so unique and thought-provoking. Have you read any of his works?"],"652":["A: Yeah, that's crazy! I don't know if it's true, but it sounds like a lot of money."],"653":["A: Yeah, I think it's crazy! I didn't know that about his high school games."],"654":["A: Yeah, I've heard that too. It's crazy to think that Lebron's high school games were so popular. I wonder if he was already a star even back then."],"655":["A: That's incredible! I've heard that Lebron's high school games were always highly attended and competitive, but I didn't know the ticket prices were that high. It's amazing to think that he was already generating that kind of buzz and revenue even back then."],"656":["A: I like Tim Duncan. He is a good player."],"657":["A: I think so. He's a good example for young players."],"658":["A: Yeah, it's great to have a plan B, you know?"],"659":["A: That's a great point. I think it's also impressive that he was able to balance his basketball career with his education, considering how demanding the NBA can be."],"660":["A: I like radio. It's fun to listen."],"661":["A: Yeah, it's easy. You need a coil, a magnet, and a diode. You can make a simple radio with a tin can and some wire."],"662":["A: Yeah, it's really amazing! You can make a simple radio with just a few things like a coil, a magnet, and a diode. You can find instructions online."],"663":["A: That's a great point about the electromagnetic waves. Actually, you can make a simple radio using a few basic components, such as a transistor, a capacitor, and a coil of wire. It's a fun DIY project that can be quite educational."],"664":["A: Yeah, it's weird. I like watching the game with my friends."],"665":["A: Yeah, it's weird. I think it's because of the players' schedules. They have to be ready to play at any time."],"666":["A: Yeah, it's weird. I mean, the players are the ones who are supposed to be the stars, but the cheerleaders are the ones who are really entertaining."],"667":["A: That's interesting. I've heard that the teams have different rules for their staff and players, but I didn't know it was that strict. Do you think the players' salaries are justified considering the physical demands of the sport?"],"668":["A: I like watch funny videos on utube. My favourite is PewDiePie."],"669":["A: I like watching educational videos on utube. My kids learn a lot from them."],"670":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how popular it's become. I've even used it to learn some new skills, like how to fix a leaky faucet."],"671":["A: I completely agree, it's amazing how quickly YouTube has grown and become such a significant part of our daily lives. The way it has evolved from a simple video-sharing platform to a global phenomenon is truly remarkable."],"672":["A: He is very angry. He want to stop the bad people."],"673":["A: He is very angry. He wants to stop the bad people."],"674":["A: That's when he meets Yinsen, a brilliant scientist who helps him repair the suit and understand its capabilities."],"675":["A: \"I'm aware of the situation, Rhodes. I've already taken care of the situation in Afghanistan. Now, I need you to get me a secure location to land and figure out how to get these jets off my tail.\""],"676":["A: It's called the Supreme Court Chamber."],"677":["A: It's called the \"En Banc Court\"."],"678":["A: It's called the \"En Banc Court\"."],"679":["A: Ah, it's called the \"En Banc Chamber\"."],"680":["A: He is my favourite actor."],"681":["A: He is my favourite actor."],"682":["A: Yeah, he's a great actor."],"683":["A: I've seen him in \"The Big Lebowski\", he's hilarious!"],"684":["A: Yeah, it's very relaxing. I watch it every night."],"685":["A: Yeah, it's very relaxing. I watch it every evening."],"686":["A: Yeah, it's really calming. I like watching it when I'm feeling stressed."],"687":["A: That's amazing! I can imagine it would be very calming to watch a fireplace for an hour."],"688":["A: I have a book."],"689":["A: I have a book."],"690":["A: What do you have?"],"691":["A: What do you have?"],"692":["A: Ha ha, that's crazy!"],"693":["A: Ha ha, that's crazy! I think the lions would have a lot of power then!"],"694":["A: Ha ha, that's a good question! I think the constitution would have to be very clear about that!"],"695":["A: That's a thought-provoking question! I suppose it would be a unique challenge for the electoral commission to ensure the safety of voters in that scenario."],"696":["A: That's true. I like the Golden State Warriors."],"697":["A: Yeah, I know. They are very good players."],"698":["A: Yeah, I remember that. The Golden State Warriors were really upset about that loss."],"699":["A: That's true, but did you know that the Cavaliers' comeback from a 3-1 deficit in that series is considered one of the greatest comebacks in NBA history?"],"700":["A: Yes, I think so."],"701":["A: Yeah, I don't think so."],"702":["A: Yeah, I think so. It's a classic film."],"703":["A: In my opinion, it's a thought-provoking film that raises important questions about the consequences of playing with technology."],"704":["A: Yeah!"],"705":["A: Yeah, it's true! Disney makes a lot of money from toys and merchandise."],"706":["A: Yeah, it's true! Disney and toy companies have a close relationship. They often work together to create movies that will sell well with toys."],"707":["A: That's correct! The toy industry plays a significant role in the production of Disney animations, especially in terms of merchandising and marketing. In fact, the success of the toys often influences the storyline and character development of the films. It's a clever strategy to create a win-win situation for both the film and the toy industry."],"708":["A: I think the director did a good job."],"709":["A: Yeah, I think it's good that it's not from Gatsby's point of view. It's more interesting to see the story from outside."],"710":["A: Yeah, I think that's what makes the movie interesting, it's not just about Gatsby's wealth and parties, it's about the themes and characters."],"711":["A: That's a good point, B. The use of an outside narrator allows for a more objective perspective, which adds depth to the story. The symbolism of the green light is indeed significant, as it represents the elusive American Dream that Gatsby is striving for."],"712":["A: I like football!"],"713":["A: I like football, but I don't watch it much. I prefer to play it with my friends."],"714":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy! I love watching the highlights, though. They're always so exciting!"],"715":["A: That's true, the commercial breaks and halftime shows can really drag on. I've heard some teams are considering implementing a 12-minute shot clock to speed up the game."],"716":["A: It's a good film."],"717":["A: It's a good film."],"718":["A: It's a funny movie."],"719":["A: It's one of my favorite childhood movies."],"720":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan! It's a nice place. I like sushi."],"721":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan! It's a very different place. I went to Tokyo and saw the big tower."],"722":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan once, it was a great experience. I stayed in Tokyo for a few days and visited some famous temples and shrines. The food was amazing too!"],"723":["A: Yeah, I've been to Japan once, it was an amazing experience! I spent a week in Tokyo and visited some of the famous temples and shrines. The food was incredible, especially the sushi. I also went to the Fuji Five Lakes region and saw the beautiful scenery."],"724":["A: That's true. I use my phone a lot."],"725":["A: That's true, I heard it's very expensive too."],"726":["A: That's true, I heard that too. But I think it's a good idea to have a backup plan, just in case something goes wrong."],"727":["A: That's true, but I've heard that the Russians are working on a new project to develop a computer that can run on solar power, which would be a huge breakthrough."],"728":["A: I know, it's very strange."],"729":["A: I know, it's very unique. The special effects are amazing."],"730":["A: Yeah, it's a really unique story. The special effects are amazing too."],"731":["A: Yes, it's a unique storyline, but the special effects are really impressive, and the actress who plays the mute woman gives a remarkable performance, conveying a lot of emotion without speaking."],"732":["A: I like action movies too. They are exciting!"],"733":["A: Yeah, I like drama movies too. I think my favourite one is \"Titanic\". Have you seen it?"],"734":["A: Yeah, I love watching movies! I've seen some great ones recently, like that new Marvel movie. Have you seen it?"],"735":["A: Actually, I've been meaning to explore more genres, like documentaries and indie films. I've heard they're really thought-provoking and can offer a fresh perspective on current issues. Have you seen any good ones recently?"],"736":["A: He is my favorite player."],"737":["A: Really? I didn't know that."],"738":["A: Really? I didn't know that. What was her name?"],"739":["A: That's interesting, I didn't know that. What was his sister's name and what position did she play?"],"740":["A: He want it for him?"],"741":["A: He want it for him?"],"742":["A: Does he like Strickland because he is the Villain?"],"743":["A: Does he have a special connection with Strickland that makes him improve, or does he actually get worse because of him?"],"744":["A: It's good, yes. People like it."],"745":["A: I think it's a good film. Many people like it."],"746":["A: Well, most people like it, but some think it's too childish."],"747":["A: Honestly, I'm intrigued by the mixed opinions. Some people seem to love it, while others find it too childish. I'm curious to know what you thought of it, since you've seen it."],"748":["A: That's crazy! I like Michael Jackson's music."],"749":["A: That's crazy! I love Michael Jackson's music, but he was definitely a weird guy."],"750":["A: That's crazy! I've heard he was a bit of a show-off. Did you know he also wanted to make a movie about a pet chimpanzee that could play basketball?"],"751":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the eccentricities of celebrities. Did you know that Michael Jackson was also a perfectionist when it came to his music videos? He would often spend hours rehearsing a single dance move until it was just right."],"752":["A: No, everyone liked it."],"753":["A: No, everyone liked it."],"754":["A: Yeah, some people thought it was too long and slow-paced."],"755":["A: Actually, I was surprised to find that some critics felt the special effects were overused, which detracted from the overall impact of the story."],"756":["A: That's very sad. I like playing games too. Do you like playing games?"],"757":["A: That's so sad. I think we should do something to help stop gun violence."],"758":["A: Yeah, it's really sad. I think we should do something to help prevent gun violence."],"759":["A: That's indeed a tragic story. It's astonishing how some people's efforts to make a positive impact can be cut short by senseless violence."],"760":["A: Ha ha, nice one!"],"761":["A: Ha ha, that's a good one! I never knew that."],"762":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. What was his personality like?"],"763":["A: That's interesting! I didn't know that. I suppose it's not every day you get to meet a president, let alone one from a different country."],"764":["A: I'm not native, I'm from England. I like your country, it's very beautiful!"],"765":["A: I'm not native, I'm from England. I like your country, it's very beautiful."],"766":["A: Yeah, I'm not a native speaker, I'm from the UK. I've been living here for a few years now. It's true, golf courses do use a lot of water, don't they?"],"767":["A: That's really interesting! I've never thought about the environmental impact of golf courses. I'm not a native Czech, I'm from the UK, but I've been living here for a few years now."],"768":["A: Yeah, it's a drama."],"769":["A: Yeah, it's a drama."],"770":["A: Yeah, it's a drama, but it's not just about the corruption and fraud, it's also about the personal struggles of the main character."],"771":["A: Yes, it's a drama, but it's not just about the corruption and fraud, it's also about the personal struggles of the main character, how he's torn between his loyalty to his colleagues and his own moral principles."],"772":["A: That's funny! I like the idea of a reality show."],"773":["A: That's funny! I think the runner up would be very surprised to live in the guest house."],"774":["A: That's crazy! I didn't know that. I guess they're not very good at updating their technology."],"775":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about the floppy disks. I guess they're still holding on to some old technology."],"776":["A: She was very good too."],"777":["A: She was very good too. She played Kay Graham, the first woman publisher of the Washington Post."],"778":["A: She was great too, she played Kay Graham, the first female publisher of the Washington Post."],"779":["A: Meryl Streep was outstanding as Katharine Graham, the first female publisher of the Washington Post. Her performance was nuanced and captivating, bringing depth to the character."],"780":["A: Ah, Justin Timberlake! He sang the song for the Super Bowl."],"781":["A: Ah, Justin Timberlake! He's a famous singer. He performed at the Super Bowl halftime show a few years ago."],"782":["A: Ah, Justin Timberlake! He performed at the Super Bowl halftime show a few years ago."],"783":["Here is a possible next turn of A that uses grammatical items on CEFR level B2:\n\nA: Actually, I think it's a clever move by YouTube to advertise during the Super Bowl, as it reaches a massive audience. It's a great way to promote their platform and attract new users."],"784":["A: Ah, yes! I think it was 2008."],"785":["A: Ah, yes! I think it was released in 2008."],"786":["A: Ah, yes! I think it was released in 2008."],"787":["A: Ah, yes, I think it was released in 2008. That was a great year for animation, with several notable films coming out."],"788":["A: Ah, yes! I see it now. It's like a button on my phone."],"789":["A: Ah, I see! So it's like the three dots on some apps, right?"],"790":["A: Ah, I think I know what you mean! It's like the three dots on some apps where you can find more options, right?"],"791":["A: Ah, I think I've seen that before, but I never knew what it was called. It's quite convenient to have all those options in one place, isn't it?"],"792":["A: That's amazing!"],"793":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how much money it would be now."],"794":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how much money can add up over time."],"795":["A: That's amazing, I had no idea about the Gmail story! It's incredible how some of these deals can have such a significant impact on the future of a company."],"796":["A: I like Google Maps. It helps me find my way."],"797":["A: I know, it's amazing! I also like Google Maps, it helps me find my way."],"798":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. I think it's great that the government is doing something good for the environment."],"799":["A: That's amazing! I've always been impressed by Norway's commitment to environmental causes."],"800":["A: I like sharks! They are very strong."],"801":["A: I think it's amazing! They are very smart."],"802":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see a trained shark bark!"],"803":["A: That's amazing! I can imagine a shark barking, it's quite an unusual thought. I've always been curious about their intelligence, do you think they're as smart as other marine animals?"],"804":["A: Yeah, that's true! He's a good example too."],"805":["A: Yeah, it's true! And Demetri Martin is still doing well, I think he's a good example for people who want to follow their passion."],"806":["A: Yeah, it's great that he followed his passion, even if it was unconventional. I think it's really admirable that he didn't let the opportunity slip away."],"807":["A: That's true, and it's great to see people taking risks and following their passions. I think it's also important to remember that success is not just about achieving a certain goal, but also about being happy and fulfilled in the process."],"808":["A: He is very lucky."],"809":["A: He must be very happy with his life."],"810":["A: That's amazing! I'm sure they have a big house too."],"811":["I'm sure they must have a team of financial advisors helping them manage their wealth."],"812":["A: Yes, I use Facebook."],"813":["A: Yeah, I do. I like to share funny videos with my friends."],"814":["A: Yeah, I do. I like to keep up with my friends and family on there."],"815":["A: Yeah, I do. I actually joined a fan group for The Simpsons and we're always discussing episodes and sharing trivia. It's really cool to connect with other fans who share the same interests."],"816":["A: Yeah, I know. Disney is very careful about that."],"817":["A: Yeah, I know. They also changed Snow White to Snow and the Seven Dwarfs."],"818":["A: Yeah, I think it's weird how they do that. They changed the name of Mulan too, didn't they?"],"819":["A: That's true, and I think it's interesting how they also changed the name of Mulan from \"Mulan: The Warrior\" to just \"Mulan\" to make it more appealing to a wider audience."],"820":["A: I think it's funny when Buzz says \"To infinity and beyond!\""],"821":["A: I think it's funny when Buzz says \"To infinity and beyond!\" because it's not true."],"822":["A: Yeah, I agree. It's funny how Buzz's character adds a new level to the story."],"823":["A: That's a great point. The way Buzz's character is developed adds a layer of complexity to the story, making it more engaging and memorable. His delusion about being a space ranger also highlights the theme of identity and how it's shaped by our experiences and perceptions."],"824":["A: That's crazy! I know, right?"],"825":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I think it's a great way to make court more interesting."],"826":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I mean, who would have thought a judge would use rap to make a ruling? It's definitely a new way to approach things."],"827":["A: That's what I thought! It's amazing how creative lawyers can be. I've also heard that the judge's rap was quite impressive, actually."],"828":["A: Me too, I like Superman better."],"829":["A: Yeah, I didn't like the movie. The action scenes were cool, but the story was boring."],"830":["A: Yeah, I didn't like the plot, it was a bit confusing."],"831":["A: Yeah, I was expecting more action and less focus on the origin story."],"832":["A: He is very sad."],"833":["A: Yeah, it's a sad movie."],"834":["A: Yeah, it's a sad movie."],"835":["A: Yeah, it's a pretty sad movie, but the special effects are amazing."],"836":["A: I no, never! That sounds crazy!"],"837":["A: No, I never see that before. Is it a special game?"],"838":["A: That's amazing! I've never seen a game like that before. Is it a special kind of tournament?"],"839":["A: Actually, I've never seen a game like that before, but I've heard it's quite an exciting experience. I've always been fascinated by the creativity and strategy involved in such matches."],"840":["A: It's a surprise!"],"841":["A: Yeah, it's a big surprise! The main character is actually the bad guy!"],"842":["I think it's a good twist, but I didn't see it coming."],"843":["I think the twist is that the animals are actually humans who have been transformed into animals due to some kind of experiment gone wrong. It's a really clever plot device that adds a whole new layer of depth to the story."],"844":["A: Yeah, Minnie is a classic name!"],"845":["A: Yeah, Minnie is a classic name. I like it."],"846":["A: Yeah, I think it's still popular, but maybe not as much as it used to be. I used to watch it with my family when I was younger."],"847":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about Minnie's name. I think it's interesting how some names can transcend time and remain popular despite being \"dated\"."],"848":["A: Yeah, I know, right?"],"849":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's like they want to make it more exciting!"],"850":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's like they wanted to make it more dramatic or something."],"851":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's like they're trying to pay homage to each other's franchises."],"852":["A: Elmo is funny."],"853":["A: Me too!"],"854":["A: Yeah, it's not every day you see a Muppet on Capitol Hill!"],"855":["A: I'm glad we could share our thoughts on that unusual news. It's not every day you see a Muppet making headlines!"],"856":["A: He is rich."],"857":["A: He's very lucky."],"858":["A: That's crazy! I think it's because she's a successful businesswoman."],"859":["A: That's ridiculous! It's not fair that she earns more than him, just because she's his wife."],"860":["A: I know, right? Very cold!"],"861":["A: Yeah, it's been cold here lately."],"862":["A: Yeah, it's been a crazy winter so far!"],"863":["A: Yeah, it's been a crazy winter so far. I'm glad I don't have to deal with it here. How about you, where are you from?"],"864":["A: That's true. I like libraries because they are free."],"865":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how much things have changed. Now we can get any book we want with just a few clicks."],"866":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how much things have changed. I remember my grandma telling me stories about going to the library when she was a kid and having to write down the title of the book she wanted to borrow on a card."],"867":["A: That's a great point, and it's amazing to think about how much has changed since then. In fact, the concept of a public library as we know it today is a relatively recent development, dating back to the late 19th century."],"868":["A: Yeah, I know. He was a great player."],"869":["A: Yeah, I know that one. He got a lot of money from Reebok."],"870":["A: Yeah, I remember that. He got a lot of money from that deal, didn't he?"],"871":["A: Yeah, I've heard about that. I think it was a really smart move for him, considering he was a young player at the time."],"872":["A: That sounds like a fun store! I like to find new things."],"873":["A: That sounds like a fun store! I like to find new and unusual things."],"874":["A: That sounds like a really unique store! I've heard of stores like that before, but I've never been to one. I wonder if they have any interesting items from the 80s or 90s."],"875":["A: That sounds like a fascinating store! I've heard of similar concepts, like thrift stores that sell items donated by people who have moved abroad. I wonder if they have any unique items from the 80s and 90s, like old computer parts or VHS tapes."],"876":["A: I like Bob Marley too. His music is very good."],"877":["A: Yeah, that's amazing! I love his music too."],"878":["A: Yeah, that's amazing! I think his music is still very popular today, especially among older people."],"879":["A: That's impressive, but I think Frank Sinatra's music has stood the test of time, and his songs are still widely popular today, even among younger generations."],"880":["A: I know, it's crazy! I like my shoes simple and comfortable."],"881":["A: I know, it's crazy! I think we should focus on comfort and practicality more."],"882":["A: I know, it's amazing! And it's not just shoes, I think we also overdo it with handbags. Some of them are so big and heavy, it's like carrying a small animal around."],"883":["A: It's astonishing, isn't it? The way some designers prioritize aesthetics over practicality. I mean, I've seen shoes with heels so high they're almost impossible to walk in."],"884":["A: Ah, yeah! I like Hugh Laurie, he's a good actor."],"885":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy how some actors get paid so much!"],"886":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy how some actors can earn so much money. But I think it's great that we can still enjoy their work for free on websites like that."],"887":["A: That's true, but I think it's great that we can still enjoy classic entertainment without breaking the bank."],"888":["A: Ah, nice! I like Monty Python too!"],"889":["A: Ah, nice! I love Monty Python too!"],"890":["A: Yeah, I love Monty Python! Their humor is so unique and clever."],"891":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been a fan of Monty Python's surreal sense of humor. Their ability to blend absurdity with clever wordplay is truly unique."],"892":["A: Me too!"],"893":["A: Yeah, it's a nice place. I went there once. I saw the big room where they have meetings."],"894":["A: Yeah, it's a really cool place. I went there once with my family when I was a kid. We took a tour and saw the Oval Office. It was amazing!"],"895":["A: Yeah, it's definitely a unique experience. I've been there twice, and it's amazing to see the history and grandeur up close. The East Wing is particularly impressive, with its beautiful gardens and art collection."],"896":["A: Yes, it is true story."],"897":["A: Yes, it is a true story."],"898":["A: Yeah, it's a biographical drama, based on Michael Oher's life."],"899":["A: Yes, it's a biographical drama film based on Michael Oher's life, and it's widely praised for its portrayal of his inspiring journey from a troubled childhood to becoming a successful NFL player."],"900":["A: I like Netflix."],"901":["A: I know, right? It's amazing!"],"902":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know it was that popular. What kind of shows do you usually watch on Netflix?"],"903":["A: I'm glad to hear that, it's amazing how a single idea can lead to such a massive success story."],"904":["A: Yeah, I like Sulley and Mike, they are funny."],"905":["A: Yeah, I know, right? The other characters are a bit forgettable."],"906":["A: Yeah, I think the supporting characters could have been more developed."],"907":["A: I completely understand what you mean, the supporting characters often get overshadowed by the main protagonists, but I think the unique personalities of the Oozma Kappa members, like Kon and Fuyuki, added a nice touch to the story."],"908":["A: I like action movies."],"909":["A: Yeah, I like Christopher Nolan. He's a good director."],"910":["A: Yeah, I've heard it's really good, but I haven't seen it yet."],"911":["A: Yeah, I've heard it's a visually stunning film, but I've also heard it's quite intense and emotional."],"912":["A: I like Edna Mode, she is funny."],"913":["A: That's amazing! I loved the first one too. It was a great movie."],"914":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how fast time goes by. I still have the DVD somewhere."],"915":["A: It's amazing how well the animation holds up over time. The attention to detail and the characters' personalities are still so well-developed."],"916":["A: Wow, that's amazing! Google is very strong."],"917":["A: That's amazing! Google is very smart."],"918":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that. What does Calico do?"],"919":["A: That's fascinating! Calico is a life sciences company focused on aging and longevity, isn't it? I've heard they're making significant progress in understanding the human genome and its relationship to aging."],"920":["A: I like Thomas the Tank Engine. It's a good show."],"921":["A: I think it's true, a good show is a good show, and people like it."],"922":["A: Yeah, I agree, a good show is a good show, no matter what language it's in."],"923":["A: I completely agree, a good show can transcend age groups, and it's interesting to see how different cultures adapt and modify content to suit their audience."],"924":["A: I don't know. What is it?"],"925":["A: Yeah, I know what a foxhole radio is. It's a small radio that soldiers used in the war. My grandfather had one."],"926":["A: Yeah, I've heard of it. It's a small radio that soldiers used during the war. My grandfather had one. He used to tell me stories about it."],"927":["A: Actually, I've heard of Foxhole Radio, it's a community-driven platform where people share and discover old-time radio shows. I've been meaning to explore it more, but I've been busy with work and personal projects. Do you think it's worth checking out, or is it just a niche interest?"],"928":["A: He is very good at this job."],"929":["A: He is very good at selling, yes?"],"930":["A: That's interesting. Did he make a lot of money with those penny stocks?"],"931":["A: That's interesting. Did his involvement in the penny stock market lead to any significant financial losses for investors?"],"932":["A: Yeah, I like Air Jordans. They are good shoes."],"933":["A: Yeah, I like them. They are very comfortable."],"934":["A: Yeah, I love them! I've got a pair of Air Jordan 11s that I wear all the time."],"935":["A: Yeah, I've always been a fan of their design and comfort. In fact, I think they're one of the few brands that have managed to maintain their quality and style over the years."],"936":["A: I no like Imagine Dragons too. They sing too loud."],"937":["A: I don't think Imagine Dragons is that bad. I like their songs."],"938":["A: That's crazy! I didn't know that. I think people just like to hate on popular bands, you know?"],"939":["A: That's really interesting, but I think we were talking about music. I'm surprised Imagine Dragons didn't get more criticism, considering their overplayed songs."],"940":["A: I like Rotten Tomatoes. They are very honest."],"941":["A: Ah, okay! I didn't know that. Is it a good site?"],"942":["A: Ah, I see! So, Rotten Tomatoes is a website, not Netflix. That's good to know!"],"943":["A: Ah, I see! So, Rotten Tomatoes is an independent website, not affiliated with Netflix. That's interesting!"],"944":["A: Yeah, I think so."],"945":["A: Yeah, I think so. It's not good for the environment."],"946":["A: Yeah, I agree, it's a shame. Maybe we could also consider a bike-sharing system like they have in some European cities. It would be a more environmentally friendly option."],"947":["A: That's a valid point, and it's not just Iceland, many countries in Europe are struggling with the same issue. In fact, I've heard that some cities are even considering replacing their tram networks with buses, citing the high maintenance costs of the former."],"948":["A: He is good player."],"949":["A: He's a good player, yes?"],"950":["A: Yeah, Baker Mayfield is a talented guy. I think he's a great example of how people can pursue their passions, even if they're not traditional."],"951":["A: That's amazing! I've always been fascinated by the intersection of sports and gaming. I've heard that some professional gamers are actually quite athletic, too. Do you think Baker Mayfield's gaming skills give him an edge on the field?"],"952":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that."],"953":["A: Yeah, it's really strange. I think it's because animals feel happy when they have a white patch on their forehead."],"954":["A: Yeah, it's really weird! I think it's because animals with white patches on their foreheads can see their owners better. Maybe it's a way to communicate or something."],"955":["A: That's fascinating! I've also read that some species of birds, like chickens, have a similar phenomenon where they develop white patches on their heads as a result of domestication. It's amazing how these tiny changes can occur over time."],"956":["A: Yeah, that's true. Humans are strong."],"957":["A: Yeah, that's really sad. I wonder if the park rangers will increase the warning signs now."],"958":["A: Yeah, it's amazing what our bodies can do. I didn't know that about humans regrowing a rib either. I guess it's good to know we have some natural defenses."],"959":["A: Yeah, it's unbelievable. I've heard that humans can regrow some bones, but I didn't know it was a rib specifically. It's fascinating how our bodies can heal in such ways."],"960":["A: I no see it."],"961":["A: Yeah, I saw it. It was good."],"962":["A: Yeah, I saw it last week. I didn't really like it. The plot was confusing and the characters were not well-developed."],"963":["A: Actually, I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've been meaning to. What did you think of it?"],"964":["A: Good."],"965":["A: What is the name of the movie?"],"966":["A: So, what do you think about the plot?"],"967":["A: That's quite an unusual premise. What kind of challenges do you think the rabbit police officer would face in this story?"],"968":["A: I like movies."],"969":["A: I don't know. I like action movies, but this one is old."],"970":["A: Yeah, I'm curious now. I didn't know it was based on a true story."],"971":["A: I'm intrigued by the unique approach to codebreaking, but I'm not sure if I'd enjoy the film as a whole. Can you tell me more about the plot and the characters?"],"972":["A: I like classic American cars too. They are very old."],"973":["A: I like old movies too. Do you like watching them?"],"974":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I've always wanted to visit the Henry Ford Museum to learn more about the history of American cars."],"975":["A: That's fascinating! I didn't know that about Cadillac. I've always been drawn to the sleek designs of those old American cars, especially the fins on the 1950s models."],"976":["A: Yeah, I know."],"977":["A: Yeah, I know."],"978":["A: Yeah, I know, she's been really busy."],"979":["A: That's because she's been in a lot of smaller, independent films as well."],"980":["A: He is very brave!"],"981":["A: Yeah, I like Batman! He's very brave and strong."],"982":["A: Yeah, I can see why you think that. He's really dedicated to his cause and doesn't care about the rules."],"983":["A: I completely agree, his dedication to his mission is truly admirable. It's amazing how he's able to balance his personal life with his responsibilities as a vigilante, considering he's always on the move."],"984":["A: Yeah, me too. I like watch funny videos."],"985":["A: Yeah, me too. I like watching tutorials on YouTube."],"986":["A: Yeah, me too. I like watching tutorials on there, they're really helpful."],"987":["A: Exactly, it's really convenient and informative. I've learned a lot of new skills from YouTube tutorials, especially when it comes to DIY projects and cooking."],"988":["A: I KNOW, RIGHT? IT'S VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND."],"989":["A: I KNOW, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE WATCHING IT AND YOU'RE LIKE \"WHOA, WHAT'S GOING ON?\""],"990":["A: I KNOW, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE WATCHING IT AND YOU'RE LIKE \"WHAT'S GOING ON?!\""],"991":["A: Yeah, I had trouble following the plot at times. But the special effects were amazing, especially the zero-gravity hotel fight scene."],"992":["A: I think it's interesting."],"993":["A: Yeah, it's interesting. I like learning new things."],"994":["A: Yeah, it's interesting to learn about the origins of things. I've heard that the word \"sandwich\" comes from a British nobleman named John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich."],"995":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been interested in the origins of brand names. I've heard that the word \"gasoline\" comes from the Latin word \"petroleum\", which is derived from the Greek word \"petra\", meaning rock or stone."],"996":["A: Yeah, that's crazy! I don't think it's a good idea to make AI like that."],"997":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I heard they had to shut down the AI because it was spreading hate speech."],"998":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I mean, I've seen some pretty ridiculous comments too. But I guess that's what happens when you have a platform with so many users."],"999":["A: That's true, the online community can be overwhelming at times.
