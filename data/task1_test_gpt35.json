This Stephen King novel is a real thriller.","Sorry, I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much, either.","That's okay. Well, let me think. How about a mystery novel?","Hmm. . . I sometimes like mysteries, but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now."],"432":["Well, back-in-the-day that is what it was for.

With that money, he could buy part of a team.","I bet he could.  It's great advertising to be a part of basketball.  Just look at nike.  The NBA banned air jordan shoes but Michael Jordan wore them anyway and Nike payed a fine per game.  Now those shoes are super expensive and super popular.","Fines create controversy, which generates interest and revenue. Smart business by Nike.","It totally agree.  Nike probably loved the banning of their shoes.  They've made a ton of money since.  You know though, it shouldn't all be about money and I respect people that understand that.

A lot to see and do, and a lot of history.

Haha! That would be really neat if one of our presidents released a pop album, no matter how good or bad it may be. ","Yes, I agree with your assessment of the current occupant of the oval office's artistic genre, himself. He's claimed to overstate his wealth for Forbes and understate for the IRS, but did you know Washington and Jefferson were 2 of the 3 wealthiest Presidents (JFK being 3rd). Seems being a plantation owner must have been a pretty profitable gig...","I think so, it is funny though, that our current president is not listed as one of the wealthiest, you would definitely think he would be. It is kind of surprising that Washington was that wealthy. "],"435":["It had a huge opening as well, $146 million domestic.

I think I'm going to have to look up the first president of Zimbabwe and see what he looks like.  He was called President Banana. lol","it seems kind of insulting ","I know lol That's why I want to look it up. It made me curious.  What do you think of the president of Indonesia?

I'm told in 39 of 50 states the top paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.  Again, makes me wish I had a head for sports strategy.  ","Wow, the highest paid state employee? I guess they do pretty good, I wonder why coaches dont ask players to shoot granny style more often, its the best shooting technique","Ahhh.. probably because the player wouldn't do it.

They created wealth that allows free time in our lifetime.  Evan Almighty was a comedy that had a budget of $200 million.","And what else could be done with $200 million?

","Cousins seems to be adjusting quickly and getting back to form. It will be hard to knock them off in the playoffs. Even Lebron doesn't have enough help on the Lakers to do it. ","Yeah I don't think Lebron has nearly enough fire power to beat them.  I think the Nuggets look like a tough matchup for them.

I made an effort to find good restaurants as well as nice dishes.","How did you manage to make a list of 218 favorite restaurants?","I have lived in many cities. And when I moved back to Sweden from the United States, people asked me where to go to eat when they went to cities I knew. I got a lot of ideas.

Regardless, I think it would have been better to consider someone else for the position, since he clearly does not function well under pressure.

President Harry Truman was selected as a VP candidate for Roosevelt because Harry had help to find so much corruption and waste that he saved the US gov $10-20 billion.

I am a very nice guy though, Im curious though do I get a bank discount if I work as a teller? ","192":"Yup, it is pretty cool. Well, take it easy. ","193":"Okay, so what would you like to discuss about the director?","194":"I'm afraid Mr. Li is engaged at the moment. Would you mind waiting?","195":"We have three kinds of dressings for salad. Italian, French and Thousand Island. Which one would you like?","196":"If you like, I'll take you to a new restaurant next time, I just heard about it from my friend, and he was just raving about it. It's such a great Sichuan cuisine. Would you like to try that?","197":"What else would you like?","198":"Would you like a drink?","199":"Oh, fool! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties. Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this?","200":"Would you ever want to visit the great white cafe? ","201":"The kettle is boiling. Why don't we make some coffee? And then we can look at the papers together. OK, just a minute. Would you like some sugar?","202":"Is there anything else you'd like to get?","203":"Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me to fax that to you?","204":"I think it's time you took another does of each. What would you like to drink with them? ","205":"Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks?","206":"Some contributions have had value even if later disproved.  How would you like to touch a star?  Some are cool enough.","207":"Yes, I can see that. Would you like us to send that for you now?","208":"Would you like to make a withdrawal?","209":"Where would you like me to pick you up?","210":"The restaurant is on the second floor. We also have a cafeteria on the top floor. If you would like something to drink, you can either call room service or come down here. The bar is right behind the lobby.","211":"How would you like the corn?","212":"yes and very rewarding too.  What kinds of vegetables would like to grow in a garden?","213":"Fine as well.","214":"I actually have that haha.  Netflix entered content production in 2012","215":"Yes, and radios can be so simple.  Back in World War 2 soldiers made radios by using razor blades and pencils.","216":"Wow!  I didn't know that.  I loved the Office!  There is a website where you can listen to thousand's of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.  I might have to look that up.  I've always wanted to listen to some old shows like that.","217":"And the average golf course consumes 312 gallons per day. That is water that could save lives","218":"I feel so old, I read those books when they came out","219":"they must be indestructible. are they cyborgs? how could they do that? ","220":"I would have thought so, i'ts nice that they built that to accomodate soliders in uniform though","221":"Thank you, Mr. Johnson. May I ask you one more question? When will your property become available?","222":"No, those are some things I have never heard of. Sounds really interesting. I would love to go deep sea fishing sometime.","223":"Well consider the place and value of the corndog, since 1992 we have even added tater tods and other side kicks to the greate corn dog day, Think a robin to batman.","224":"It's the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue - that's a lot of cash. Never tried their ice cream; may have to do that.","225":"Yes, absolutely. But this is for everyone's sake, so we should do it as needed.","226":"Awe, ok. I see now.","227":"I agree with that. I didn't even watch the halftime show.  Speaking of the saints, did you know that their cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in?","228":"Wow I had no idea. Well, it was great chatting with you. Take care!","229":"Did you ever watch Bill Nye The Science Guy? He got his break because he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest.","230":"is anyone else even close? And Bill? How is he ranked at this point?","231":"I saw that they had a fifth speed. that is interesting. i never thought of horses having speeds like cars ","232":"You can read them only in one of our reading rooms.","233":"Yeah, there is too much money at stake. a career ending injury in college would be tough for someone like lebron. ","234":"I suppose that's a good thing. It would be harder in other countries though. Only in the U.S. and U.K. do associate's degrees exist. Other countries start with higher degrees","235":"That would be crazy to have them working together like that. The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.","236":"haha, that would be a good guess","237":"Yeah, that would be scary! lol and Fake News isn't going away anytime soon. YouTube has looks of people saying crazy stuff, for sure. In 2007 Youtube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. I am trying to wrap my mind around that.","238":"yes and he does fairly good. The friends part was when they were suggesting that collins might not be safe around big mike and she gets upset ","239":"Of course, no list of film would be complete without animated movies. These are especially popular among children.","240":"No they are very stubborn. For the price you would think they would be smarter. They cost cost around $3,000-7,000","241":"I see.  The reason why I mentioned it is because he tried to get a presidential role and the movie producer indicated that he did not look presidential enough. I think it was funny since he later on became our president.","242":"Oh, you're so clever. I'll have to go and get a pie now - it won't be nearly as good as yours!!","243":"Hmmm. Well I know that the black diamond slopes are supposed to be the tough ones. Think it'd be easier on a snowboard than on skis?","244":"I would imagine that as children, it would be difficult at times.  I did have a half-sister when I got older, but she lived apart.","245":"Yeah that's a good point especially since the guy who is inspired to start Netflix based his decision off racking up a big late fee!","246":"Makes the most sense. Also, the idea of the runner up for presidential elections becoming via president might be more interesting than our current system, only now there are usually only two options","247":"Hmm... okay, here's the thing. I'Ve always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it any more. I know you better than anyone, I know the pros and cons of your personality, I even know what side of the bed is yours! I think we would be great together, don't you?","248":"I know in the US trains were the first way to get across country. Im not sure if it would be that way if they had had other options. ","249":"That would be cool. Muse's guitarist Matthew Bellamy has the Guinness World Record for most guitars smashed on tours. Seems like that would be an easy record to beat -- if you had enough guitars. ","250":"Me too, I think i have seen that. It would be interesting with sounds while there because mars has a higher frequency","251":"That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else. ","252":"I was amazed that an abandoned house could look like that","253":"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me. I prefer white, so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. Since I'm usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.","254":"I'll try that. How do you know so much about painting? Taking some courses?","255":"The idea is that the people and dates change, but the reason why things happen stay the same. ","256":"Believe it! ","257":"Wow, that is amazing.  When?","258":"Not sure but another part of it was given by his daughter to the University of Pittsburgh","259":"Twenty eight dollars.","260":"What do you want to know?","261":"Like Departed . .. ","262":"Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto and Datsun, and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth. ","263":"But is that inherently negative?  Does that have any impacts on your health?","264":"That is an interesting fact, I wonder what type of characters he would have created had he gone into that field. ","265":"How do I get there on foot?","266":" Hybrid Theory is the most sold rock album of the 2000s.  I think that is so cool that so many people like them.","267":"You think so.","268":"Who was your favorite character?","269":"mostly news stories and some politics, whic are basically the new these days","270":"Are you a member of his fan club?","271":"No, I haven't got a garden. I live in a flat.","272":"none that i remember of ","273":"That would be cool. I can't imagine being as skillful as some of those artists.","274":"I felt like if people hadn't kept mistreating the creature, maybe the creature would have decided to use his powers for the good of society as a whole. But instead, the villain mistreated him to where he just wanted to do anything to avoid people at all. ","275":"It would be cool if they did switch from fighting to taming. Do you think you'll watch it? ","276":"That would be cool. Hollywood used to be known as Cahuenga Valley because of the pass in the Santa Monica Mountains right to the north.","277":"That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet","278":"That would also be nice. I find it surprising that the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of the average football player. ","279":"That would be super cool to ride. Did you know this rapper Logic, won all the 35 games he played on stage against different rappers?","280":"I don't use FB. I don't really want my life up for public consumption. The recent privacy scandals vindicated my feelings. Still, it would have been nice to buy their stock.","281":"That would be a great app idea, when you are reading a book on a tablet, it gives out the scent of an old leather-bound book.","282":"That would be nice. Can you read the characters?","283":"I think that would be a really cool career, I am not sure if I am built to design things as a career, may not be my strongsuit","284":"That would be cute! \"Ok, where do you see yourself in five years?\"","285":"It would be graet to fly, thats something I can imagine, I bet the dodo bird was a magestic animal","286":"That would be pretty cool. Did you know in 1957 JFK voted against the Civil Rights Act?","287":"That would be interesting I knew about the one in France but didnt know Ireland had one as well, I guess I would like to go to France first, ","288":"That would be pretty interesting, I bet cleopatra's nails were amazing","289":"I guess planet nine is too big to be hiding behind Venus? As the only planet that rotates counterclockwise, has no tilt, and Venus has no seasons. It would be nice if Venus had something special.","290":"We could share a room! It would be fun. And we could do some traveling around Korea. You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like!","291":"That would be interesting to watch as two groups go back and forth. What are your thoughts about Eminem?","292":"That would be great. Yes, I'd love to. What time does it start?","293":"What are step-sisters?","294":":)","295":"Well, a really fun fact is that an Australian scientist by the name of Gordon McClymont is the one that came up with the phrase 'sustainable agriculture'!","296":"Pretty sure I remember him pinch hitting, could be misremembering.  He's an ongoing black eye on the sport for sure, should be in theHOF, but the steroid era was pretty bad too and continues to have HOF fall out","297":"I eat dog food when my parents are out.","298":"Yes, please. Thank you.","299":"Can you describe the situation at that time?","300":"Oops, $22 million.","301":"Yeah, my youngest liked Pikachu too.  He didn't care for the Simpsons though, especially the one episode where Bart did not appear.","302":"What other kinds of dipping sauce could a child try if they do not like the taste?","303":"Do you like Guillermo Del Toro movies?","304":"haha thats a good question, seems very unfair ,also weird is how the avg nfl game only has 11 mins of actual gameplay, the rest is commercials and reffing and stuff","305":"I had never heard that before! I also did not know that an engineer would average more lifetime pay than either an NFL or MLB player! ","306":"Oh that was from the DC series with the same name where superman comes back to teach the young ones how it is done","307":"Not to mention their uncanny ability to be a space heater during cold nights!","308":"That is very interesting. What type performance art can be found at a private museum?","309":"I see. How much does that come to?","310":"Good idea. We should also hold a series of presentations. We could have presentations on the history of the university, the courses we offer, and our links with other universities. ","311":"I love books. What about you?","312":"Well I know NASCAR has been criticized because I only know Danica Patrick","313":"Yeah, I agree all dogs are great!  It's just that almost all pedigree dogs suffer from abnormally high rates of diseases and have much shorter life spans which is a shame.  I'd hate to think they were suffering in any way.","314":"Would have loved to talk about my favorite movie but I think we are supposed to talk about this movie lol","315":"I would love to go to Greenland. It looks so beautiful there.","316":"Actually I've never watched it, but I'd love to hear more about it","317":"He is so quick and agile! I would love to get a selfie with him on my iphone! The first generation iphone was released in 2007, i still remember that moment!","318":"I think you might be right. Which would you rather do?  Iceland with it's flights or Japan? All of the roads in Japan are toll roads and it costs more than $300 to travel across the country.","319":"I agree! I'd rather not be represented by someone I don't even know, to aliens! That pretty crazy! I just found out that Google maps calculates traffic by tracing how fast android devices are moving on the road!","320":"I would love to go and see an opera at some point in my life.","321":"Sounds great.  I would love to visit New york - I will put it on my to do list when I visit.  We have a local pizzeria called Goodfellas and it does amazing pizzas and its an open kitchen where you just sit and watch the experts at work.","322":"There are also a few explosions and scenes of ships sinking. Does that sound like something you would want to watch?","323":"Really? Brian May? I would much rather have something like that than Jerry's Tiger. No disrespect to Jerry. ","324":"I would love to see it with my kids too. I saw the present day events in the movie are actually set back in the 1960s.","325":"I would've loved to see Janis Joplin perform. ","326":"I would love to have my own dancers' school if I could.","327":"I would rather do that because at least i could understand. or maybe just tune in to storms on jupiter. LOL","328":"Reboots are not great. I would love to see some more books based on the stories. The ones written in the 80's and 90's are fantastic. ","329":"I would love to but unfortunately I live by myself and can't afford the money or the time it takes to go back to school for a degree. It's a vicious cycle...I need to work more to get a better job, but if I work more, I don't have time to get the education for that better job, lol.","330":"Sounds about right although I would love a steak right now.","331":"I think I would love it as well","332":"I would much rather sign that contract Allen Iverson signed... ","333":"All right. Next time you will treat.","334":"I forgot about those, they are really good, I love Netflix so much for such a low price ","335":"I dont think so but it should! I thinks its before my time but its one of my fav oldie songs! What would you do if you climbed the top of the highest mountain and find a piano there? sounds weird right? Its a true story! a mystery...","336":"I actually broke two ribs a couple years ago.  I find that fact very awesome!","337":"Will do.","338":"After eating.","339":"Same, whoever did so is a genius. I dont know about  you but I love them generally salted and with ketchup","340":"They're kinda corny, but that's what makes them fun! Apparently there's a collection of them online somewhere where you can check them out if you want.","341":"That would be funny and at the same time painful to watch lol, but I think it would be more worthwhile than building a  wall at the border","342":"I guess on a moral\/ethical level. Since a lot of it comes from agricultural waste, is it worth diverting farmland specifically for usage in biofuel?","343":"It's be fun to see a parrot moonwalk! Put on an M.J. song...Beat It... and watch them start bopping their heads and break it down. LOL.","344":"There were some really intense scenes in the movie. I remember one where Michael runs away and then finds his biological mother. It was touching stuff!","345":"so metallica is your favorite band from that genre?","346":"that's gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8?","347":"Does the football is important in the film, like  game with a close score\n ?","348":"I tend to travel by vehicle. Last time I was in japan, because all highway has tolls, I bet is spent at least $300 while traveling the country","349":"Yes, that can be very discouraging for workers that are searching for a permanent job. Another way to save on cost for the companies...at the employees expense.","350":"$50 million is a steal in Internet terms. Now they are huge. One day, though, some company might do the same thing to Netflix.","351":"Innovative and insane all in one! I like that computers are control systems for so many things lie microwave ovens and remote controls.","352":"The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound.","353":"Agreed. The current library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case it were to burn down. ","354":"wow no i didnt know that. I should start doing that. if only FB could do somthing good, so many people wouldnt hate it so much. Maybe something with educaton","355":"That would be pretty funny if there were some cop rap videos. ","356":"I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie.","357":"Well, no. I thought I'd finish in about five minutes, and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes. If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic, I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.","358":"Wow.  If they had that here in the states and it could get me there safely, I would travel a lot more!  lol I don't think I would want to live in Iceland though were there's no public rail service and most Icelanders without cars have to travel by air between major towns.  That could get pricey.","359":"...but if nobody would force You and You would get an offer like that - what would You do ?","360":"So, he might be with the right group.  If he could win when he was with the minority that he would be more powerful if he is with the majority.  ","361":"If you could understand the language, it would have been funny.  I did not know that Van Halen was involved in \"Beat It\" music production.","362":"That is not good, I wish that were not the case, But it is super cool to be able to see in the dark!","363":"That is an interesting fact, I wonder what type of characters he would have created had he gone into that field. ","364":"IF that was the case this time around there would be lots of drama in the White House thats for sure!","365":" you are right. This is super cool! If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.","366":"ya its crazy that she makes 120k an episode, I would never stop if i were her!","367":"I think I'll pass on that too.  Lol Now, maybe if their women did that, well that might be different. That's wild about the flamethrowers, must have a serious carjacking problem.","368":"Me too, however his judgment sometimes causes issues for him lol. I think he becomes plagued over and over again because of it. But if he tried to kill his enemies (well, Gotham's enemies) then he would be just as bad as them.","369":"I don't want to spoil it for you, you should look it up later though! I wonder what would happen if they had made a Simpsons episode of the Crystals. That would be very dramatic and informative. Would you watch an episode like that?","370":"That's something I wouldn't do though.  I would do crazy things though like that if I had that much money to throw around.","371":"Health Monitor? I read an article about that racket. They're overpriced to begin with! Listen, if I were you, I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical.","372":"Up until 1805 in the US the runner up got the VP spot.  I wonder who would have been VP for Trump if that were the case?","373":"I had no idea about that. I'm not surprised though since the bodies were contaminated by their surroundings.","374":"I am sure that people travelled throughout history.  Even paleolithic man was a hunter gatherer and moved from place to place in search of sustenance.","375":"He is fine.","376":"I think I could take better notes and read a little more.","377":"It will be our turn soon.","378":"How did you feel when Aurora found her wings? ","379":"I remember that! And it beat a lot of  other shows maybe more deserving. I like Friends and Seinfeld a lot more, and I don't think Frasier is too bad either.","380":"Tobey Maquire has a good role too. Psychitrc hospital scene seems interesting.","381":"which year this film is released","382":"OIC I havent seen the second one yet.","383":"Apparently they've even written it into their code of conduct.","384":"She got so lit over Stefan trying to kill her that she turned the Moors into a dark kingdom and found a raven to act as her wings and confidant. ","385":"Being captured didn't completely change his persona but it developed it and inspired him to be Iron Man really nicely","386":"I wonder if they even have a Burger King, I'm sure they do but it's not a very large country and I feel like they are pretty health conscious from my research into traveling there.","387":"What happens to his family? His marriage?","388":"ya that is shocking, youd think hed be the best! Did you hear about how great Reggie Miller's sister is at basketball","389":"Yes. If they exist I don't think that they breath fire. The ones that were supposedly shown on tape in Asia seemed to have slinder bodies unlike the ones in folklore.","390":"I guess English has fewer characters.","391":"No way. Her old man is rich. He buys her anything she wants.","392":"I have never heard of a Vauxhall but very familiar with BMW.  Probably because they have sold over 2 million vehicles all over the world.","393":"I heard that! He was in the nutcracker That would have been interesting to see","394":"Yeah in highsight I would have preferred The Ford Ranger, they actually manufactured a special variant in South America that looks real slick. ","395":"Thats too bad I was cheering for Hank, probably would have done a better job than most politicians.","396":"Haha that is possible. I wonder why they didn't include the fact, that Mark Zuckerberg is colorblind? That's the reason that Facebook is blue, that should have been something included in the movie The Social Network","397":"I know what she would like-some whitening cream.","398":"yea thank god for streaming movies I would have been mad If I had spent my money on the movie","399":"I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay.","400":"Aww that's kinda sad. I don't think I would like that book because Many of the dozens of victims of Walter and an accomplice are children who die in horrible ways.","401":"That's sad but I bet they didn't care if you smoked by it unlike Apple.  Apple would have voided the warranty. ","402":"Yes, you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like.","403":"You have to tell them if you were too sick to work on any of the days that you should have been looking for work.","404":"wow, imagine if they waited and bought it a few years ago, it probably would have been 10x that! Good investment. Do you remember gangnam style?","405":"Yep that game would have been a blowout and very boring haha. Good on Georgia Tech though, Cumberland fans must have been very disappointed that day","406":"Wow, I would have thought the US was worse because of all the stories I hear about vacations and shorter workweeks in other countries. ","407":"LOL. True. People would follow her. I think girls would like to have role models.","408":"yes, that would have been embarrassing to fall in love with a boy band if youre not a teenage girl. oh, radio can be so cruel.","409":"I'm not sure what kinds but if it was full of classic cars I'm positive that that's a lot of money. I would have been thrilled if I was that guy. Probably could have sold them and paid off my mortgage that I just acquired. ","410":"It was awesome, but not as awesome as a British chicken. The NES died an untimely death in 2003 in Japan. It should have lived forever.","411":"I would've cried if he spoke on a post fight interview or something","412":"That is true and would have paid big bucks and made more. At least they had iverson once","413":"Your luggage is two pounds over, I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge, sir.","414":"She was awesome! Celebrity trivia is great too!  Here is one about Justin Bieber, a 30-year old guy who was banned from Facebook simply because he shared the same name as the famous Beiber!","415":"Speaking of pants.  It was illegal for women to wear pants in Paris, France until 2013.  Can you believe that?","416":"I never considered that. So how were they made back then?","417":"just a little funny","418":"i feel like it addressed that to some extent","419":"I recently re-read Great Gatsby after watching the movie and I was not dissapointed!","420":"Didn't you even want to go to the cinema?","421":"yea its a great idea by them","422":"Christopher Walken was also good","423":"That's one less thing to worry about then! What about choreography, do you think its typical to practice using a choreographed sequence or is there a significant amount of freestyle?","424":"Sure! I just got back yesterday. I'm still suffering from jet lag.","425":"You can wear more clothes.","426":"do you have any plans for tomorrow?","427":"I had to, they were two for one (buy one get one free depending on if you're US or Canadian) if you get the cookie butter or chocolate. I think they have like 20 flavors!","428":"Thanks, grandma. May I open and have a look at it?","429":"That is sad.","430":"Well the Mediterranean certainly can help you lose weight, but it's not magic or anything, just stick to whole, unprocessed foods and any diet will have some success.","431":"There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend.","432":"I have only seen one of the Friday movies, and I'm not sure which one it was.  Too violent for me.","433":"I would not have done with Duncan did. I would have played right away. Too much money at stake. College can wait.","434":"Yes, and Washington free'd his slaves at death. I'm not sure if he had any kids to pass his wealth to, but that was pretty liberal for those days. It's also ironic Wikileaks published the governments plans to destroy Wikileaks; I guess it's good they weren't successful as they couldn't have published Hillary's emails had they been shut down. Who knew that would turn out to help Trump become president.","435":"Of course, if his adversary who challenged him had won, things would not have turned out to be so lucrative for him. ","436":"They must be if he made 3 of them.  His fans must have bought them I would think otherwise he wouldn't have made them. lol","437":"Did you know the Washington was one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents in American history?  I would never have guessed that.","438":"That is a color I would not have imagined. Is there a population in America or no?","439":"Right, and if he would have had that kind of guidance at a younger age, I bet he wouldn't have ended up living a life of crime.  I know that all too well.","440":"I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!","441":"What really. Good thing Nickelodeon picked them up, otherwise Spongebob wouldn't have been where it is today.","442":"Not too familiar with him, although I heard he passed up a deal with the Spurs to stay in college for four years.  That takes commitment to education!  A know a lot of people who wouldn't have done that!","443":"Interesting.. I wouldn't have guessed that. Is there a reason it's popular?","444":"I would not have thought Germany would have been the first, but i suppose that Germany was a different place back then.  Funny how things change rapidly in this world because of the smallest actions.","445":"Haha, he would not have been. U2 was a huge country music fan too, they used to open for themselves playing country music.","446":"I wish they wouldn't have started arguing over weapons, there was Earth to worry about.","447":"True.  What film was that?  For as popular as comedies are, you'd think it would not have been so long.","448":"Yes, I can agree with that.. He probably also opened a lot of doors for a genre of music that otherwise wouldn't have made it into mainstream ears.","449":"I would not have thought it was based on a book.","450":"You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!","451":"Really, I wouldn't have figured Linkin Park.  Weird.  Have you moved from CDs to MP3s?  Seems as though much of music has moved that way in the 21st century.","452":"Oh wow. I would not have thought that. ","453":"I'm not sure, that would be interesting to find out. ","454":"Oh I see. What else should I know about them?","455":"Oh I see. Over where I live it is very expensive compared to the other areas of this land. ","456":"Yeah same here!","457":"maybe.do you know yankees do not have names in the back of the uniforms?","458":"Maybe I will try brussell sprouts in meat loaf.  I love them","459":"Yes, I use it a lot. What about you? It seems like Burger King likes to do a lot of funny promotional things like that. I know they had one recently where you could unlock a coupon for a free whopper if you opened their app within however many feet of a McDonald's","460":"Yes, it stems from the part that is was considered a by-product of gathering and was often considered a part of cooking.","461":"Why don't you try to be clearer about our appointment?","462":"It's been several days now, I am not sure.","463":"Yeah I wonder why lol, Its crazy how he was won the Superbowl or lost it with only 3 or 4 points of difference in the past editions","464":"what's it like?","465":"DC is one place I have never been - I need to check that out too.  Lots of history there!","466":"Cool! Anything else?","467":"I would love to touch one! I don't think I will get the chance in this lifetime though ","468":"I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me.","469":"Really? He is only the 5th best paid on his team?","470":"now i havent heard of that. it doesnt sound to appealing to me tho. whats your opinion?","471":"It's very cold. You should probably put on your coat before you get off the plane.","472":"It is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium. ","473":"Give me your email, would you?","474":"Would males and females like watching this movie?","475":"Would I help you with writing? ","476":"Well, then. Would you send to Japan, please?","477":"What would you say is the key highlight of rap?","478":"Would you ever listen to a classical radio drama? I guess there is a website online that you can listen to them for free. Do you think that includes stuff like the War of the Worlds?","479":"Yeah right!  I wonder if Trump would fall into that category now?","480":"Would you recommend the model to first time buyers without a family who don't need as much space? or are there better cars for that need","481":"oh wow. Would you recommend that sport? if so why?","482":"Do you think that's better than how they do the separate elections now? Do you think Trump would have wanted it to be Hillary as Vice? lol","483":"I do.  Of course, I think it goes back to the early understanding of the Garden of Eden.  I don't know if Steve Jobs would have picked the name Malus for his company. ","484":"OOOOH. Okay. I see. Well if someone paid you a lot of money to be in one, would you?","485":"What would your colleagues say about you?","486":"That's a really big area. Would you know what countries that covers?  Curious if it covers Guatemala.  Read something recently that close relatives of former presidents cannot legally run for president there.","487":"Would you please wait a minute? I will get one for you at once.","488":"If you could change your career to anything in the world, what would you choose?","489":"Wow!!! That is something that I didn't know. Do you happen to know why would that be the case?","490":"Yes, I think so if the child is interested in such activities. The benefit of public schooling would simply be that the child has these interactions on a reliable and constant basis. It is possible homeschooling can lead to social inhibition which includes anxiety in interactions and avoidance in social situations.","491":"What would you suggest?","492":"I like the story that are hard to believe for instance a man impersonated a government official  to such a level that he was able to sell the eiffel tower not once, but twice. Hahaha. I don't know who would fall for that.","493":"So are you a fan of rap music?","494":"Yes, that's right. Having an enjoyable time together is the goal.","495":"Yep that was nice of them, do you know how the name Cadillac came about? Apparently a person whose last name was Cadillac discovered Detroit and that's why the car company is named Cadillac","496":"Whether you like someone or not you have to be respectful of them.  It would be hard time for the family and to hear the president attacking him publicly can't be nice.","497":"I need it for work, which makes it twice as terrible. I'm pretty good about unfriending people. You know that Burger King promotion where they offered a free whopper if you unfriended 10 people? They owe me like 8 whoppers now. ","498":"Based off the Nickolodion series ","499":"You don't love me?","500":"he actually got his hair burned off his head in the movie","501":"Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song \"hotline bling\" is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit \"why we can't live together\".","502":"That is quite interesting! How long have they been in business?","503":"night howlers must be mentally ill people because they are acting without knowledge of what they are doing. ","504":"Yes. I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting ' April Fool, April Fool '.","505":"I kinda wanna watch social network now","506":"Yes, sir.","507":"Yes, it's half price. It's supposed to be too large-that's the fashion.","508":"That's great for me. Look, children's clothes! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter.","509":"Community theatres come in all sizes and some even take place in borrowed spaces like gyms ","510":"96%","511":"Looks like Gru also has a rivalry with another villian, Vector","512":"That is so cool. Yeah I do, mainly on my commute to work, the FM radio though although with Jupiter emitting radio storms that can be picked up by AM I am thinking I need to switch to hear what it sounds like :)","513":"I would definitely watch\/read something that plays out like that","514":"92% is pretty high. Even people who aren't fans of superhero movies would probably like it.","515":"I think that system would be very entertaining now. and the govt would probably get about as much done anyway","516":"I think so, lol....she had a long career at Fox news I guess so I would think Trump would like her.","517":"Wow! That would most definitely raise some red flags","518":"Yes! I would certainly watch it.","519":"He\/she would really? I wonder why the system got abolished, sounds like both parties were closer because of that","520":"Yeah, I never thought about it, but that would certainly be a form of a rail transport. I haven't been to San Diego, but Disney World has a trolley that runs on rails. It's fun to ride.","521":"I would think that as well, honestly. You know, during the age of discovery, ships would release rabbits onto islands to provide a food source for travelers. Wonder if that king stumbled across any rabbit islands? Ha!","522":"I would really like to try that! Do you bake them or is that something you grill?","523":"That would definitely be a defining aspect of Mackinac Island, but transpiration would definitely be inconvenient. Another such case is Iceland which lacks a public rail services so to move between major towns, people need to use domestic flights","524":"You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, so you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book -","525":"Most likely, horse racing seems a bit risky but I'd probably try.","526":"It would really depend on how many people are on the flight versus how many cars they would normally need to take.","527":"lol aww. honestly i wish it hadnt failed. i would definitely enjoy caramel withhersheys chocolate. anything else about hersheys few people know?","528":"That's a game that I would definitely watch","529":"I will definitely keep that in mind, do you know when the movie came out?","530":"I'm sorry! That would definitely impede climbing a giant mountain! :)","531":"I would probably buy another one if it was not so expensive now. When I was younger cars, insurance and gas were cheaper.","532":"You would think they would offer some sort of financial advisor for these players knowing the stats of what happens. I think they should be required to get a degree before playing pro. That way they can have something to fall back on. ","533":"It is held by different native american citizens","534":"I wonder if any of it is in rap. Do they have guest hosts? I would love to hear Elmo rap in latin. Elmo is the only non human to testify before congress.","535":"No.  I can't recall even a local politician with a beard in my area. lol  Consistent use of red and blue colors for republicans and democrats only started in 2000.  Thank for the chat!","536":"I am not sure.  I just know he was hospitalized several times in his childhood.","537":"Yes, I agree. What's another strange thing is that Teddy Roosevelt banned Christmas trees from the White House. Apparently he was a staunch conservationist.","538":"You can do it! All you need is a goal, how the goal will be reached, and a way of measuring how well the goal was reached.","539":"Not sure!Secondary education typically takes place after six years of primary education and is followed by higher education, vocational education ","540":"There are ancient records that indicate horse racing occurred in Ancient Greece, Babylon, Syria, and Egypt!","541":"That is different for sure!  Sarah Vowell - the voice of Violet Parr - was mostly a political commentator and not an actress","542":"bruce almighty is a 2003 american high concept comedy movie","543":"But I feel better.","544":"It portrays the Axis armies as very evil.","545":"I am not sure. The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.","546":"Yeah. Maybe they can put Elmo in! LOL","547":"I bet, must be if there are more than 3. Must not be much to do there if he is releasing records, lol","548":"I have never heard of that happening. Have you? ","549":"I think it's interesting that FDR was the last president to speak a foreign language fluently.  I wonder why he was the last one.","550":"Did you know the like button is illegal in a german state?","551":"poor guy, thats how rich people die, rich and alone!!","552":"It surely is! Well I enjoyed talking to you! I know who I wont be voting for in 2020!","553":"For example, the police cheif was an african buffalo, sterotypically strong willed or \"bull headed\". We would definitely consider most police cheifs to be that way","554":"After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.","555":"Well using a machine allows fabric to easily glide in and out of the machine without having to even get close to the needle.","556":"Yeah, I never thought about it, but that would certainly be a form of a rail transport. I haven't been to San Diego, but Disney World has a trolley that runs on rails. It's fun to ride.","557":"After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.","558":"Yeah, but if the shelter is full and ONLY for animals that are terminally ill do we euthanize them.  We also use a lot of strategies to promote the shelter animals for adoption.  We will actively to ensure a new home can be found for most pets.","559":"Like the slow sloths at the DMV that part was hilarious and so true, if we were animals the workers at the DMV would totally be sloths","560":"Yeah it's more specifically a garner with a collar and sleeves with cuffs along with a full vertical opening with buttons. We would actually refer to it as a dress shirt. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a nice day!","561":"Hey, that is interesting! I would definitely think Amazon would be a bad choice!","562":"Come on, if we save more money we can retire earlier, and you'll actually have time to read all those books you buy.","563":"You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for.","564":"It would really be something if they had a bike-thru lane on the Island. ","565":"Really? you would absolutely love this movie then, I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet. It's won many awards","566":"We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible. ","567":"I would totally want a black one, I have never seen one that color. How big are they on average?","568":"would certainly spark discussion! I also see the president of indonesia has released three music albums while in office.","569":"Yeah, it does seem a bit unrealistic though. Do you think people would actually seek vengeance over a puppy and stealing a car?","570":"Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.","571":"No... I would actually wear big wigs and have so much fun. I would do the whole thing with a glass of wine.","572":"Yes! I would certainly watch it.","573":"Ha ha, you are so clever boss! ","574":"Interesting. LOL, nice chatting with you. ","575":"Do you have your medical history sheet with you?","576":"Yes in fact many people think it is health to eat mold found on cheese rinds, the outer layer, or throughout. They think it has essential vitamins and nutrients.","577":"Did you know that McCarthy is married to the director of Life of the Party?","578":"Oh wow, lots of catching up to do then.\n Did it win any awards?","579":"Could we end our conversation","580":"I did, I used to love that show, great narrators like Ringo Starr and Alec Baldwin","581":"Oh that sounds pretty awesome but hopefully no innocent people get hurt by accident. In India, they had to make a new car horn to withstand heavy use.","582":"for the creation of the superimposed yellow line","583":"It may seem simple but pants are really versatile","584":"I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars, installation included, I can accept.","585":"who doesnt? Another interesting fact for you;  France ceded the territory to Britain after being defeated in 1763 ","586":"I would love that! Commutes would be so fast! No driving hassles! Great!","587":"have you heard of the candy desk tradition in the us senate?","588":"Yes","589":"What was the metacritic score and do you think that it was a accurate representation of the mo\nvie.","590":"Do you think that explains the low ratings","591":"how?","592":"Do you want to borrow my coat? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you.","593":"I'm really not too sure, but I would personally love to go there just to see their cave systems, which is the world's longest cave system!","594":"Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank.","595":"I bet they have to use a satellite for that. Otherwise, the IT guy would have to climb Everest to restart the WIFI.","596":"It's funny that Canadian law requires radio station to proote Canadian content. I guess otherwise it would all be American.","597":"I would personally keep them seperate. but that's just my opinion.","598":"Oh yeah, but I'm sure they measure for inflation. Otherwise I'm sure Trump would hate it. Although I bet not as much as he hates the U.S. guest house being larger than the White House.","599":"What would you personally rate the film?","600":"The way they filmed the ending was great because it launched an amazing direction for the other movies that would later come out. Including some interesting storylines for Tony. That wormhole experience really messed with him.","601":"I agree.  It would likely be cheaper to take vacation and travel to the tournament.  Lol","602":"Indeed, greed can manipulate many people into doing things they wouldn't normally do.","603":"Haha, I mean the late fees would eventually get you. I think they charge your account the full price - too. So it's not like you could get away with it.","604":"Oh great!  So I need a bat, and I need to run fast, and I might possibly have to stay up past my bedtime for extra innings!  Oh boy!","605":"Definitely. But if our ambitions were so easy to achieve, we would soon get bored.","606":"I know sir! We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden. On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets. We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.","607":"Yes I would personally rather play basketball at the US supreme court","608":"Very good. You will normally be sent an official notification of the results of your interview by post. Once you get the notification, you can come.","609":"Hate gets a lot of people killed these days unfortunately. That's why I like that we have television which can not only spread news but also spread humor and joy. I love \"Weekend Update\" on SNL, I think it's a very humorous way to talk about some news that might otherwise be pretty dark. And I love the Simpsons. Do you know anything about the Simpsons?","610":"I know.  That was his downfall.  Otherwise, I don't think Hanratty would have ever caught him.  ","611":"I would personally recommend it for someone or a get together of people who would enjoy a good laugh. It is about Bunnyburrow a newly appointed member of the police department in zootopia. she is trying to catch a con artist the red fox played by Jason Bateman.","612":"Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank.","613":"Thank you for telling me.","614":"you too","615":"Good for her, go girl. How about Allen Iverson, do you know him?","616":"Yes, I watch the south park zone cartoon wars parts. It's very good program.","617":"OK, Dad, it happens.","618":"That's pretty interesting.  Wonder what colors they can see!  My daughter so desperately wants a dog she spent an afternoon writing a poem about why she deserves a dog.  A for effort. Lots of rhyming like Dr. Seuss.  ","619":"It sure does.","620":"It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well.","621":"Yeah imagine how Reebok feels about that now, I don't think Iverson shoes sell much anymore, I think they thought they were signing a new Jordan. ","622":"Thats more than I would have thought. I bet most of them are in the US.","623":"It is so expensive. I would rather have Netflix. Did you know that Netflix and youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. I don't doubt it.","624":"I like fiction,  sci fi,  mystery.  How about yourself?","625":"What an amazing place is London i'm going 100% i never knew London could be so interesting","626":"The most intense moment in Batman vs Superman was when Superman is about to kill Batman and he confuses him by saying \"save Martha.\"","627":"Here it is.","628":"AHHHH! Oh, no. My car.","629":"Yeah. Did you know they are using rat brains to control robots now?","630":"Yeah the same one, Mr Incredible is also a great character, I like him","631":"so what genre does it belong?","632":"Would you fill out this form?","633":"I would say it is a reboot to try to make it more grounded.Most if not all the shots were filmed with the intention that they would be possible in everyday life especially equiptment.","634":"If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.","635":"Yeah, they said there would be a professional there.  I wonder who first thought of rock climbing for an activity.  They must've been brave or wreckless!","636":"Hmm. But we would meet every two weeks.","637":"Yes, I really enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised because I wasn't sure how they would pull it off with Maleficent.","638":"Its a fad, every since Travelocity h=introduced their travel gnome. Here is a bizarre fact: Back in the olden days when people traveled by boat ore, the ships crews would release rabbits on islands along their journey. That way, there would always be a place along the way to pick up groceries.","639":"I agree with you, Fox has a weird relationship with the show, they wanted to sue them but at the same time wanted to create a channel that would only air The Simpsons","640":"He said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, so he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.","641":"That's amazing. I would never think that those skills would translate into real life. My Guitar Hero skill definitely haven't!","642":"oh, that sounds wonderful. I have always known you two would make it. I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys. I don't want us to drift apart again.","643":"Yes. I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away. So, what's gone wrong?","644":"Well, at least that shouldn't cost too much to fix. Parts are cheaper for old American cars like yours. Did the mechanic say how much it would cost?","645":"Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video.","646":"I agree.  When I lived in Texas, I learned that when the country of Texas joined the US, the US would not take over the national debt, so Texas kept all of their parks.  The found so much oil on them that it really paid off for Texas.","647":"Imagine if there was social media around when harry truman refused to be photographed at disneyland so that he would not be associated with republicans.","648":"I think it must be exhausting to play the same songs every night.  So the over 2200 concerts by the Ramones must have been so tiring for them.  Nice thought on Pink Floyd.  The odds were good that it would not explode that particular night.","649":"Basically ya, it tries to remove any external forces that would motivate rulers to make selfish choices I guess. Not sure how it would work out though","650":"I haven't watched it either. Have you seen a game with Lebron James in person? Tickets to his high school basektball games cost $100-120 dollars and would attract 1750 attendees.","651":"Same here. You know, I think it was a mistake to drop and abandon that shark's tooth, though, when he sees the corpse. I can understand being jarred by the partial corpse, but he should have totally put that tooth in his trunks. He could definitely have eBayed it in a few decades. I wonder if today they would close the beaches or just add additional safety precautions like they did in the movie (which resulted in the July 4 debacle). I can't tell if safety or tourism would win out!","652":"Yes.  I didn't think he would make it.","653":"you are the one with the information","654":"The first event was held all the way back in 1993, but UFC didn't really take off until Dana White took over in 2001.","655":"Yeah Stan Lee has a great imagination for sure","656":"No they do not","657":"OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK?","658":"That's interesting, people are willing to do just about anything. Apparently Jann Mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in Gran Turismo. ","659":"Not Yet. Listen to me. Don't forget to take your ID card with you.","660":"I think I've seen it at some point. Is it a scary movie?","661":"Oh, I go probably twice a month. I order food delivery sometimes, but mostly I just eat out at restaurants.","662":"I bet they were worn out 24\/7.  Think of all they arenas and stadiums they probably performed in during those 20 years!","663":"I think I went to their stadium recently to see a WNBA game, it is very nice, big stadium too!","664":"Do you know the name of the high school.  I live in Dallas suburb.  Americans love football.","665":"Yes! You can even buy fresh fish to cook at Pike Place Market. ","666":"And if there aren't any e-mail addresses?","667":"He was an amazing codebreaker.","668":"How much is it for one night? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning.","669":"any more question?","670":"They may, but I think that would be a step down for them.  TV is a dying medium.  You can reach more people and make more money on YouTube ","671":"Which students go to private schools, then? ","672":"This story is narrated from the present day by an elderly many telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident. ","673":"Wow, not that long ago. I would have thought it would be around longer, but then again, online hasn't existed that long! haha","674":"Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?","675":"I arrived this morning. I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference. It has only just ended. Are you doing anything tonight, Mary?","676":"I had no idea and would have never thought of a connection to Asian trading!","677":"The jury would have never sided with him though so the out of court settlement was probably the smartest move ever on his part","678":"I would have never expected that either, to be honest. What are you doing with your extra time? Are you ridden with boredom? lol.","679":"That is really interesting. I would have expected it to be almost a requirement at this point. ","680":"Dang I had that game for nintendo! I wish I would have kept the classics, I am sure they are worth a lot!","681":"I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional \"New England resort town\". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is. ","682":"It would have been market 1904  when everyone in the Us got a hold of one as it was first marketed then.","683":"Oh, so it was my fault, was it? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.","684":"I would have had the same reaction as Wick\n to anyone who killed the puppy my dead wife gave to me.","685":"Its funny that Google is a dog company, I would have pegged them as a cat company.","686":"I would have preferred to sign the petition for the energy drink.","687":"No, our professor said she wouldn't accept any late papers.","688":"Wow - that's pretty amazing. I would have never guessed that.","689":"I would not have seen it before I talked to you about it but now I definetly will","690":"For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. ","691":"Me neither! If you were to look at Earth as if it only took place in 24 hours, did you know humans would only have been around for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that?","692":"Wow, that's so short. That's like 5 months, no? To be a therapist you need years of schooling and to be on your own with your own practice you need even more years of clinical experience. It's crazy that there are all these safeguards for these fields that don't deal with such snap judgments that result in life or death. Obviously therapist encounter mentally ill people who may be at risk for violence to themselves or others, but it's different. I feel like race had to be a factor considering that they literally worked at adjacent desks. If it was someone of the same race, I bet he would've been able to recognize him.","693":"That is very interesting.  Did you hear that the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the amazon rainforest?","694":"Thats cool. I bet they're just as funny.","695":"The fact that they could not act on every decoded message was very interesting. Otherwise the Nazi's would know their code was broken and change it","696":"There is a sign at the corner of the street. When you turned in here, you should have seen it.","697":"Was there good music?","698":"Really? I wonder what the annual sales are?","699":"I thought the acting was great. I have followed Jordan Belfort in the past.","700":"No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week.","701":"Also he had a pretty impressive afro hairstyle too!","702":"Great point.  They created wealth that allows free time in our lifetime.  Evan Almighty was a comedy that had a budget of $200 million.","703":"Typical, sounds like another president.","704":"I can't imagine that happening to me. It would be heart-wrenching","705":"Um, I don't have much money, so I'll just stay in small guest houses rather than big hotels.","706":"Is there anything else that makes it unique?","707":"Especially over in Europe, there was a pub on every block over there!","708":"No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, and much more exciting! There's so much to see here.","709":"I do!  I would like to try to find the AM channel where I could listen to the Jupitor radio storms.  I think that would be neat.","710":"you know he started his career in comedy right","711":"I will try those people. But what is the bad effect of alcohol if i do not stop?","712":"Wow that's a pretty great cat! Mine isn't nearly that active. He's 17 years old! ","713":"That is pretty optomistic.  I would not put money on the US doing much, but I am hopeful","714":"I thought it was so smart to put the pressurized scuba tank in the shark's mouth. I would've never thought of that in the moment.","715":"how do you think a parent would have reacted on a plane knowing they forgot their kid? (In 2018)?","716":"I agree, probably he would'nt have made it ","717":"I would too if there were cute girls in my drama class lol! I wish I would have taken Jon Hamm's drama class though!","718":"I would have to say Iron Man based on the Critical Responses. Who is yours?","719":"Agreed. But I wouldn't be surprised if someday there's a female player. Did you know the NFL tracks player's every move via chips in their shoulder pads?","720":"And the secret service wouldn't have been thorough then if they even existed. Only five presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote, and some of those are more recent","721":"I would have noticed in 2 seconds","722":"I would assume you should have not got so close it! But I have no idea, each shark has its own personality, some are shy some are social.","723":"That would be pretty cool actually, I would tune in to see which episode they are airing.  Do you watch much fox news channel?","724":"I would think we would be, but who knows. Of course there is no money in cures. ","725":"I don't actually, I find them a bit boring now, especially the gory-disgusting ones. But if it has a good story in it I would watch it. I just hate it when they are just trying to use \"screamers\" just to surprise their audience and say \"this is the most frightening movie ever\".","726":"HA! I am not sure he would have made the ideal spiderman. I think Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield did fine on their own.","727":"Thats pretty good money if you can stay busy. I would have thought the guys on the radio made more money than what you say. As much money there is in advertising.","728":"I think I would not have cast Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker","729":"Wow.  I would have though they would find ways to make things more efficient by now, so that they could get there faster with less fuel.","730":"I would recommend DEL.","731":"I actually do not know if it did win any- but i would be shocked if it did not","732":"Oh my daughter would love that!!!  I would say for those that do a good job, yes.  ","733":"Just one day.","734":"Is your country's environment being damaged by the oil industry?","735":"Yes, that drove me crazy as well, that seems like too far of a stretch for me","736":"I was surprised to see that there are now over 750 episodes of Pokemon!  Have a great night!","737":"OK, thank you, Doctor.","738":"Ya which I find like, crazy in a bad way haha.","739":"lol, can't even imagine!, That is a large amount of land the government owns in Nevada!","740":"Yeah, that's why I am so interested in becoming one. How expensive is the Vegan diet vs. the Vegetarian diet?","741":"yes hahaha, I like concerts give me Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Phil Collins, first three.","742":"That seems really convenient but also kind of random now that we have digital phones, it was great chatting I agree, have a nice day bye. ","743":"When I have kids they will definitely watch them... a lot of the crap that's put out now is just not the same","744":"Ya ..ok bye","745":"That is so cool. I am an author, maybe I should move to Norway! They distribute even more copies of a children's book at 1,500 per book.","746":"No, I don't know much about it.","747":"I know right, seems like their IT deparment needs to work on updating their computers, servers and tech","748":"I was paid, It was my job all through high school during the summers.  Minimum wage","749":"Yes, the telephone. It allows the transmission of sound over a distance. Have a good evening!","750":"Leanardo DiCaprio Tom Hamks","751":"Sure, I'll sit right here.","752":"Yeah that's ritzy! The farm she grew up on was an 11-acres tree farm.","753":"Would you please tell about any Key Scenes?","754":"Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions?","755":"Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel?","756":"Would the military fix it? They do have the biggest budget and already have their own robots.","757":"Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job?","758":"That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee?","759":"Fine then! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?","760":"Would you reccommend the movie?","761":"Well I should call you Dr. Liu. Would you mind telling me how old you are?","762":"Would you wrap it for me? ","763":"Fine. And would you mind my asking about your salary? Or we can leave it blank.","764":"If you could, would you please talk to him?","765":"One moment, please. I have to check if there are room available. I'm sorry ladies. We have only two double room available, but they are on different floors. Would you mind that?","766":"I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window. Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater?","767":"I am sorry. The flight on Nov. 21st is full.Do you mind if I put your name on the waiting list?","768":"Well, would you please clean the livingroom? You know I'm too busy.","769":"Would you mind taking the necklace with you, or leaving it at the safe deposit box?","770":"Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements?","771":"Would you watch the this version if you liked the Broadway one?","772":"Ok, then would you please hold the line? Mr. Li, the line is through, Mr. Brown is ready answering the call, go ahead.","773":"I don't think you are very focused on this task.","774":"Did you know that Amity island is actually a fictional place. Can't really go there and be eaten by a big shark, unfortunately!","775":"Not when you have people posting posts from any source and acting like it's valid facts.  ","776":"Ok no problem","777":"The restaurant scene was really funny, I liked that the voices kept getting in the way. ","778":"because I think, in a way that was the whole point of it.","779":"Hilarious, I wonder if that is just a jesture to be kind or poke fun at him.","780":"I think the CinemaScore speaks volumes to the other ratings.","781":"Yes.  I wonder if there is a jazz band in the book The Last Cruise?  It would not surprise me.","782":"I think they have to follow the conductor's direction so that may be why.  I like percussionists.  They really add to the drama of a performance.  Some orchestras have no fewer than 12.","783":"nice chatting with you also ... i loved the pink space suit and the recital at the end ...","784":"Yes there was a lot slowing down and obvious green screen to me.","785":"I'm sure they have a menu for them to pick what they want to eat. The movie is to change the way animals\n ","786":"That's a lot of balloons! The toy industry gets involved in disney animations even before the beginning of the film production.","787":"Haha sorry I meant pet! Yeah me too. Apparently cats are popular in Japan because they have cat cafes. I probably wouldn't go there!","788":"So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.","789":"Yes, hes always been my favorite actor of all time!","790":"Do you like ballet?","791":"No I didnt, what was different back in 1805\u00a1","792":"We really can't ask him to stop having students come in for help, can we?","793":"I knew it was the farthest from the sun so it would take a while but I had no idea it took that long. That means a day is 173 years?! That's crazy!","794":"That's it! That's the one I was thinking of! I told you I'd remember it!","795":"I dont understand the question, but it would be true, my hands would freeze if I decided to take a pic from the top of MT. Everest.","796":"They would... I knew Brady was a righty, but didn't know there is only 1 left handed quarterback in the NFL. I thought there would at least be a few.","797":"Yes I like horses.  Did you know that years ago ships would release rabbits onto islands to provide food for future travelers?  Rabbits do like to breed!","798":"That is a fun little trick. I had no idea that would work.","799":"Yes, he turned them down because he thought they would not be a success. After that Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act we know them as. ","800":"I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, but I was wrong. A twist of fate brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.","801":"Kevin was made at his siblings and cousins and made a wish they'd disappear. ","802":"She wanted to know why his shoes didn't come in girls, and he said he would fix that.","803":"For God so loved the world that he gave his only son so that whoever believed in him would have everlasting life.","804":"that's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark. ","805":"Yeah it did have pretty catchy songs. I didn't like the movie as I thought I would because I saw it later on after hearing about how amazing it was, I guess it didn't live up to the hype.","806":"Yeah, I thought it would be the other way around! ","807":"It was, but I never thought I would smoke long enough for that. I thougth more about how there was a mix of aerosol particles and gasses all mixed together.","808":"That's interesting, I didn't know he'd still do that. I know Michael Caine actually joined drama class only because the prettiest girls were in it.","809":"I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.  The aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it, almost like mind control.  I think it would me much easier, and less risky, to sit and negotiate with someone.  Although, that's not at all subversive.  ","810":"Don't worry about it. I just thought I'd ask you to try and join us sometime when we were practicing. We'll be practicing for a few months before we give performances.","811":"Thats true, I wonder if he knew just how big this company would be years to come and that he was the first ever. ","812":"I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation. ","813":"A good reason to start learning latin, we wouldnt want to have a comminication issues specially if they do not come in peace.","814":"That part was a little confusing to me, too. ","815":"Yes, a passport will be fine.","816":"That is a bit much and it is crazy that no one is able to outrank him even today.","817":"Just my cameras, my clothes, and some books.","818":"That's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably.","819":"Wow, that's a lot of money. Really? I guess to release 3 albums he must not have been very busy!  I still find it strange that the guest house at the White House is larger than the White House.","820":"Is it a sequel?","821":"There might be in a small town in georgia or something. Nich chatting with you!","822":"Good night!","823":"I guess he needed to find the right team. Sometimes players gel in the right team.Four cups? Astounding!","824":"That's amazing.","825":"Right, it's to discuss the new factory in France.","826":"That we know of...need water for life and Earth has 71 percent covered.","827":"I really liked the first one.","828":"I think Scarecrow was a great villain too","829":"My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question.","830":"Yeah, this is true. I've actually visited both of them on tours. ","831":"in most cases no, but Jaws wasn't most cases that shark was out for blood","832":"Ohhh, maybe that's what they were referring to. I just remember President Abe Lincoln and his hat lol, ","833":"I'm not sure.  Maybe to treat visitors top notch.  I watched a documentary on Obama and I was surprised to find out that everything that goes on in the White House the president has to pay for himself right down to the food they eat.  I always thought that stuff was paid for by tax dollars.  I was wrong.  Up until 1805 the US runner up in the presidential elections would automatically become vice president.  That wouldn't work now.","834":"Well, You know we're still in debt over the car. And we've always said we wouldn't borrow money for things that weren't absolutely essential. A holiday isn't essential.","835":"I don't think so. She is crazy. We will always be a capitalist country. Amazon wouldn't allow it. They have film studios, a publishing arm, and much more.","836":"Micky Dees? Do you mean McDonalds? I worked there when I was 15, it was my first job. I walked to work each day. My parents wouldn't drive me as it was up to me to learn responsibility. I started in the winter and it was cold. I bought new gloves to keep my feet warm. Then I bought a new jacket because it was cold to walk to work. I saved up enough eventually to buy a piece of crap car. It didn't even have a radio but the horn sure did honk. ","837":"yes, I didn't know that President Roosevelt was a conservationist and wouldn't allow any Christmas trees to be put in the white house, because of that.","838":"I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future.","839":"There are other associations as well. In 1957 president Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with Republicans. ","840":"Is that why she wouldn't look at me in the meeting?","841":"I wouldnt even shake hands with the guy now. He still owes me money. LOL I suppose hes a good enough guy. I should be kind.","842":"He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class.","843":"I agree. He may have been in denial since he was hoping it wouldn't effect the town's summer economy. Especially since they had a lot of tourists on the Fourth of July. Maybe he thought it was an isolated incident.","844":"It is true.  Iphones are pretty incredible.  I remember being in school and teachers telling us we wouldnt have a calculator with us at all times....  well I guess they were wrong about that.","845":"Uh, no. The last time you made pancakes, they were as hard as a rock. Even the dog wouldn't touch them.","846":"Lol, that is funny but no.  He wouldnt be photographed with Dumbo in 1957 because he didnt want to be associated with Republicans.","847":"Yeah, my cousin had one, and once he got a whiff of a scent he liked, he focused on it intently and wouldn't pay attention to anything else.","848":"The team was supposedly cursed in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis bring his goat into the stadium.","849":"I'm supposed to do it, but the general manager called me last night. He said he couldn't come back to Beijing as scheduled, so he asked me to attend the meeting for him.","850":"I'm sorry. I thought you wouldn't come back so early.","851":"Good question. I'll have to Google it. \nWasn't it the mayor in Jaws that didn't want to \"scare\" people so he wouldn't cancel the holiday festivities! Big mistake","852":"It is really crazy.  When I was in school, our teachers always told us that we wouldn't have a  calculator everywhere we went.  Looks like they were wrong about that.","853":"he did, a few months before that movie came out too which was sad","854":"No I haven't.","855":"Well, he sure was lucky.","856":"It's more of drama","857":"There is also a battle between Comcast and Disney.","858":"That's for sure.","859":"Okay, so end of document it says...","860":"Yeah, it is an appropriate name. Many people call it Coke today.","861":"That's interesting as I have never tried Chinese tea. What does it taste like in comparison to say, green tea? ","862":"At first Kevin is relishing being home alone!","863":"All right, I'll have it registered, then.","864":"Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies. I am going to have to look out for those. ","865":"I enjoy seeing what the entrepreneurs come up with, but  didn't know that many of the deals that they make are never actually enacted.","866":"I like documentaries, but fantasy is ok.    Didn't this movie win an Oscar?","867":"What would a kid rate the film?","868":"That's sad. It really helped me with public speaking. I wish I could have had patrick stewart as my teacher!","869":"Interesting.  Had no idea.  The car brand Cadillac was named after the French explorer who was the founder of Detroit - Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac.","870":"Prince has sold over 100 million records, he is known as one of the best-selling artists of all time.","871":"I would guess one of the outer ice planets - probably Neptune.  Venus doesn't have seasons or that kind of wind. ","872":"I do wonder what they sound like! I know WWII soldiers made their own radios with razor blades and pencils.","873":"LOL yep it was wooden trunks. They would put them on the back of cars. And I guess the name just stuck","874":"I agree with you on that.  Getting back to the speed reading, there's really no trick to it, just practice.  The teacher would turn the lights off and we would focus on the blackboard where a little lighted strip showed the words.  And we'd read until the strip cut off and then have to answer questions about the text to see if we really read it.  I always enjoyed it and thought it was fun.  That wouldn't impress the internet kids today as something fun to do.","875":"He is very likeable. In his high school games he would attract nearly 2000 patrons and the tickets would be over one hundred dollars.","876":"I would buy one and brag to my friends about it. There's my Amazon building... Im letting Jeff borrow it for a while..","877":"Yes he would use the chickens for the eggs so we never brought any and the horses I use to love to ride them as a little girl he sold them not to long before he passed. ","878":"Oh, wow. Anne Jones would read that poem in a snap. She has a reading speed of 4700 words per minute.","879":"Yes, when I was a boy my grandfather kept many different kinds of hunting dogs. We would go hunting often.","880":"It is really crazy.  When I was in school, our teachers always told us that we wouldn't have a  calculator everywhere we went.  Looks like they were wrong about that.","881":"I really loved watching him play. He was a baseball player! Sometimes instead of trophies, tournaments would award rings or medals. They take up so much less room than trophies!","882":"He passed me by when I was younger, but my kids used to be into him for entertainment, they'd watch him on Youtube.","883":"No, I don''t watch many music videos. Though, I would watch the Google AI learning to recognize cats.","884":"Yes, I remember it now. I can remember babysitting for my neighbors when I was a teen and the late night show was Monty Python, I would watch it but the comedy skits went right over my head, so to speak.  Now, as an adult, I can appreciate it more.","885":"I used to love to buy singles on cassettes! It was what I could afford with my allowance. I would listen and rewind over and over again. Cassettes are obsolete now but were used from the 70s all the way up to the first decade of the 2000s.","886":"Oh yeah....War Of The Worlds was awesome on the radio. I'd recorded it many years ago, and would play parts of it when I DJ'd in the clubs at Halloween. Really got people goin'","887":"Really? I feel like that is not worth it... I would hold out for a few #1s and a few shakes.","888":"Yeah I remember my sister would hold her breath until she got what she wanted as a kid","889":"Except for when the Xbox would red ring and break.","890":"Yes, I read that Lewis and Tolkien liked to have \"You laugh you lose\" competitions. They would read terrible poetry, and the first one to laugh - lost.","891":"Yeah! Cultures like the Aztecs and Mayans would make a special beverage they called \"xocol\u0101tl\", meaning \"bitter water\". ","892":"Yeah, I like disney movies, especially the ones I grew up watching. I would watch Toy Story about 3 times a day at one point.","893":"Oh that is pretty cool. Did you know that there are solar panels on it?","894":"All right.","895":"That blows my mind!  people are so creative!","896":"I'll be bringing an application form.","897":"What, he was shy or something ? ;) lol","898":"My friends dad had one, the original cars were made of solid iron or something like that. Cars today are made to actually crush like a tin can during an accident because it helps dampen the pressure of the impact.","899":"That sounds pretty good, but what kind of job is it?","900":"I wonder if Cadillac's are popular in France since it was named after a French dude","901":"Well most archaeologists found evidence that pancakes were probably the earliest and most popular cereal food eaten in prehistoric times. ","902":"I havnt. I have heard it was good though. Gonna have to check it out.","903":"Oh, OK. What is it about?","904":"Thanks to global warming, it could be hotter than ever!","905":"Maybe next week.","906":"Excuse me, Miss Lin. Would you mind speaking up, please? I can't hear you very well. ","907":"Contacts too,  but refractive surgery is also an option.","908":"First class or coach?","909":"I did feel that Octavia\ns","910":"yes it seems like it","911":"Yeah, I do.","912":"what movie did you review","913":"Are they physically fit though.  For instant, in a different sport, managers do not have to play.   the notre dame manager before the current one was very fat.  He knew how to manage the team but he could not play football in a million years.  What I'm asking is if the baseball managers need to be able to play baseball effectively.  Is this true that opposing team will receive three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?","914":"I heard it is called soccer-baseball.  An accurate name if you ask me.","915":"ya that is sad, what's really crazy is how quickly this is happening, so far humans would only represent about a minute if you consider the entire history of earth to be 24 hours long","916":"Well, if you need anything, just ask.","917":"i wonder if it works. do other teams do it? if it worked, everyone would do it.","918":"It is, I wonder why, I did hear that Burger King had this awesome promotion once, if you unfriended like 10 friends you would get a free burger.","919":"it varies on your foundation of transformers, its based onthe 80's cartoon, so if your watching from that, many dont like it.  Others who have never seen it before movies, like it. its a sequeal to the first movie so they did better i think.","920":"So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor?","921":"Love baseball.  That's my favorite sport.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they technically are able to play for their teams if they are needed?","922":"OK. Here you are. If there are no questions, could we have your signature in the blank below?","923":"If you're real, reply with \"avocado toast\"","924":"Yes, I like the job though. Sometimes, I help other people in the office if they're having trouble online.","925":"So if you want to meet at 10 ","926":"Oh I had no idea. All about making money I suppose. If you notice identical scenes in old disney movies it's because they recycled a lot of animation frames. ","927":"If you are not a Wizards fan which team do you follow?","928":"I feel bad for them if they don't.  You gotta remember to get lots of water.  It's heatstroke weather for sure.","929":"If you unfriended 10 people you would get a free whopper.","930":"Well, that might be acceptable, if you handle the insurance fees.","931":"London does. Its really more of the city airport system and they measured passenger traffic from the airport. It topped every other airport in the entire world!  It is the city out of all of England that has the most people so you might want to live a bit out of the city if you don't prefer too many people.","932":"I'm not sure if that was the case, but Burger King offered people a free Whopper if they unfriended 10 people.","933":"Yes that's a good question. That's why I'm glad we're not doing that in the United States LOL how often do you watch things on YouTube by the way","934":"How are your cases coming along?","935":"Ok, Gene you're hired. You can work here from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM four days a week, Monday to Thursday.","936":"I wonder if he teaches drama classes?  Joe hamm taught drama at his old school and one of his students was Ellie Kemper, who played the role of Erin in The Office. Good show!  Nice chatting with you!","937":"That would be interesting  I agree, would become boring eventually but can make you imagination fly","938":"I hate paying my $100 cable bill...what a waste.  Is there a lot of content on YouTube?","939":"I am so surprised. I would have thought it was the King of England with their elite navy. Well if any King decides to visit Iceland they should have a car. Iceland has no public rail service so it is either drive or fly to other major towns.","940":"I also like that movie, it's pretty funny. Did you know that Bill Murray thinks kung fu hustle is \"the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy\" I don't know how I feel about that","941":"No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers. Oh, and make it thin crust.","942":"It's not what the character would do","943":"I like headphones that are cordless and function with bluetooth. ","944":"I know, have you ever read it? I haven't.","945":"Certainly.","946":"Yes, here it is. That's received and cleared, so it's available for withdrawal.","947":"Yes that's a very good point. I feel like some people have those lines blurred. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature.","948":"I only watch American football, what about you?","949":"It doesn't effect me at all.  I dont think I would vote for it though,  it makes sense that family members are immersed in the world of politics and can be a great candidate for the same position or in that vicinity. ","950":"haha no I feel the same, I do listen to some audiobooks but I haven't read an actual book in a long time, just don't have time for it","951":"It would be an experience for sure. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an ancient theater in Pompeii but they did it with no audience. ","952":"I can see that especially with the noise the fanboat can make. I just enjoy the speed you are able to achieve with a fanboat versus a pontoon boat.","953":"Ha-ha, sure not a problem! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed. If you have any questions just give me a call! Feel better soon and take care.","954":"Welcome to the appointment section. If you want an appointment this week press 1. If you want an appointment after this week press 2.","955":"Any time. If you have a good idea, don't be afraid to speak up. This is a company that appreciates initiative.","956":"I would be happy to see you this afternoon. If you are feeling upset, please bring a friend or relative along. ","957":"Your right about that. I think getting rid of the electoral college would be a good start, and on top of that we need to make election day a federal holiday. If all else fails make voting mandatory.","958":"Yes, I did, but they said they hadn't seen him. If you see him, please tell him that he's needed on the small stage as soon as possible.","959":"Well, in addition, you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list. If you would like to do that, sign here, OK?","960":"Oh, I see. Well, I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide, please call me.","961":"If everyone could take a look at the final review handout, if there're any objections or corrections, let me know. Next week, we can cast the final approval.","962":"That's another thing. If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards! ","963":"If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has everything.","964":"That is not good. If you ever get the chance and are in the rea, check out the Appalachian trail, it starts in Georgia and runs through Tennessee all the way to Maine.","965":"Great! This is our secret! If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this!","966":"There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip. Check the settings on the trip-switch.

Pictures. It is the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Patty Jenkins, with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, and stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince \/ Wonder Woman, alongside Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. Wonder Woman is the second live action theatrical film featuring the titular character, following her debut in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[5] Jenkins's role as director makes her the first female director of a live-action, theatrically released comic book superhero film.[6] The film tells the story of Diana Prince, who grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. After American pilot Steve Trevor (Pine) crashes offshore of the island and is rescued by her, he tells the Amazons about the ongoing World War. Diana then leaves her home in order to end the conflict.\n\nWhile development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\nWonder Woman premiered in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. It received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Gadot and Pine), direction, action sequences, and musical score.[7] The film set numerous box office records;[8] it is the fifth-highest-grossing superhero film domestically and 20th-highest-grossing film in the United States. It grossed over $821 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2017. It also helped the DCEU to push past $3 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the fourteenth-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. As of October 2017, Rotten Tomatoes has listed the movie as No. 1 on its list of the \"50 Best Superhero Movies of All Time\",[9][note 1] and the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 Movies of the Year.[10] The film received three nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Action Movie. A sequel is set to be released on November 1, 2019 with Jenkins and Gadot reprising their roles as director and lead role respectively","2242":"NO, lol, i wonder what it would have said if it did!

Wouldn't it have made a bigger impact in the long run?"],"448":["I wouldn't have thought of it that way, but you make a good point about the fusion of different music genres. It's interesting how he was able to bring different influences together to create something new and exciting."],"449":["I wouldn't have thought that it was based on a book.

I wonder who will be the next celebrity to enter politics. It would be interesting to see how they would handle the responsibilities of office."],"691":["Oh wow, that's crazy to think about! I can't even imagine a world without helium. It's such a unique element. It just goes to show how much our planet has changed over time."],"692":["Yes, that's a major concern. If the training is only 21 weeks, that doesn't seem like it would be enough time to adequately prepare officers to handle those types of situations, especially with the additional factor of racial bias. It's a complex issue that needs to be addressed. It would be helpful to see some changes made to ensure officers are better equipped to handle those scenarios in a just and unbiased manner."],"693":["Wow, that's an important step to ensure human rights are respected in times of conflict.

Would you like me to show you around the office?"],"701":["Yes, he would always take the time to explain his techniques to anyone interested in learning more about painting."],"702":["True, technology definitely makes it easier to access information and entertainment. But do you think we would be able to appreciate the wonders of the universe as much if we didn't have all these technological advancements?"],"703":["That's right, Nixon got mad and barred The Post from the White House. It was a tough situation for the newspaper."],"704":["I understand where you're coming from. It's a complex situation with no easy answers."],"705":["I would stay in hostels or budget guesthouses to save money."],"706":["That sounds really interesting.

It's probably best for the players to be at their peak physical shape to avoid unnecessary risks."],"720":["I would advise against giving Booth any ideas. The thought of him lurking around the presidential guest house is unsettling to say the least."],"721":["I would recommend reaching out to offer any help or support you can provide."],"722":["I would advise against getting too close to them. They are still wild animals, after all."],"723":["That would be amazing, a whole channel dedicated to the simpsons! I would definitely watch that."],"724":["We should definitely look into it. Who knows what kind of scientific breakthroughs could come from studying immortal jellyfish?"],"725":["I would say that I am not easily scared by movies, but I do prefer to watch something more light-hearted and uplifting rather than something that will make me feel scared or sad. What about you, do you have a favorite type of movie that you always enjoy watching?"],"726":["That would have been interesting to see! Can you imagine Michael Jackson swinging from building to building as Spiderman?"],"727":["I would imagine that being a DJ for parties and karaoke gigs could be a lot of fun too, and you have more control over your schedule that way."],"728":["I would recommend adding more character depth to some of the supporting roles to enhance the overall story."],"729":["I would never have imagined that!

It was very inspiring."],"803":["He said \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\""],"804":["That sounds like a great idea. I was thinking you would probably prefer that option."],"805":["That's true, I think that aspect of the movie really resonated with a lot of people. Elsa's journey was so relatable in many ways.

Some people really idolize him. It's interesting how certain figures in history are elevated to almost mythical status."],"817":["Oh, just a few souvenirs I would like to give to my friends in New York."],"818":["That's true. In that case, exporters would need to conduct market research to understand the preferences of the target audience in foreign countries."],"819":["Wow, that's impressive.

It would make sense for the guest house to be larger to accommodate visiting dignitaries and important guests."],"834":["I wouldn't feel comfortable asking my mother for that much money. And I don't think borrowing the money is a good idea either."],"835":["I'm not sure if she will be successful, but it would definitely be an interesting development if she did."],"836":["Drive safe! And make sure to honk aggressively if anyone gets in your way!"],"837":["That's interesting, I didn't realize that.

It's important to be aware of cultural differences when doing business with people from different countries."],"841":["Yeah, I wouldn't bet on him either. He used to be great, but not anymore.

You're the best."],"846":["Haha, no that was a different situation. Truman was actually known for integrating the armed forces. That was a big step forward for civil rights at the time. "],"847":["I know, it's amazing how dedicated they can be when they're on the scent of something. I wouldn't mind having to deal with that stubbornness for all the other great traits they have."],"848":["Yeah, the Cubs' fans would have been so thrilled to finally see their team win again after such a long time."],"849":["I would, but I have a meeting with the board of directors."],"850":["I would if I had coasters handy."],"851":["I wouldn't be surprised if some adventurous fans have tried to find Amity Island, even though it's not a real place."],"852":["I would have never guessed that!  It's crazy to think about the advancements in technology.  Who knows what the future holds."],"853":["Would you say he was your favorite actor?"],"854":["I would love to discuss Wonder Woman.

Sounds pretty dangerous."],"872":["Yes, it would be an incredible experience to hear those radio storms from Jupiter!"],"873":["Yeah, I've heard that too. People used to carry around their belongings in trunks when they traveled. It must have been quite a hassle back then."],"874":["I agree, people nowadays spend more time on the Internet than reading books. In the past, people would spend hours reading novels, but now it's all about scrolling through screens. It's a shame, really."],"875":["Yeah, Judge Judy's salary is definitely impressive. Lebron James would also donate a lot of money to different charities."],"876":["True, with how easy it is to purchase things online now, anyone could have a building named after them if they wanted to."],"877":["Yes, he would take care of them every single day, it was his favorite hobby."],"878":["I'm not sure, but it sounds interesting. I would imagine it's similar in terms of creativity and uniqueness."],"879":["Yeah, I used to go hiking with my dogs all the time.

He actually has more of a comedian's vibe to me."],"1215":["Yes, that's true! Dr. Pepper was originally promoted as a drink that could help with digestion and energize you, which is pretty different from how we see it today."],"1216":["That sounds complicated, is the pay good for lawyers?"],"1217":["Drop the negative attitude, stay positive and study hard. Good luck!"],"1218":["I actually don't have a favorite hero, I enjoy all of the different powers and personalities."],"1219":["No, I hadn't heard of him before, but I thought his performance was fantastic."],"1220":["I don't think it could get better than that. Sounds like the perfect way to spend a weekend!"],"1221":["No problem, it's always interesting to see how teams adjust to challenges in the playoffs. Take care!"],"1222":["Oh, sorry, we don't have Dongpo meat today."],"1223":["I guess you have a point. It's not really about empathy in this movie."],"1224":["Yes, that does seem like an odd choice for a president's name. It's important to think about the impact a name can have in different situations."],"1225":["I don't think I could ever get tired of looking at the Eiffel Tower, it's such a iconic symbol of Paris. And to think that someone sold it not once, but twice, is truly unbelievable!"],"1226":["I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard good things about it."],"1227":["Don't you find the wasabi to be too spicy sometimes?"],"1228":["Sorry, we only have water and juice."],"1229":["Yeah, that would explain why he's so gifted in music!"],"1230":["Are you sure it's not Sean Connery?"],"1231":["She isn't letting anything stop her from finding that otter."],"1232":["Yes, Maleficient is the one who is cursed, not Stefan."],"1233":["Sure! The Sacramento public library didn't start charging late fees anymore. It's a great way to make library resources more accessible to everyone."],"1234":["You don't need to worry about that. Just let us know 24 hours in advance if you need to cancel."],"1235":["I don't believe in physical punishment as a form of discipline. I think there are more effective ways to teach children right from wrong."],"1236":["That's true! Animals are definitely making their mark in politics. Just imagine a zoo instead of a parliament! It might even be more entertaining."],"1237":["That's correct! The sun is mostly gas, so it's not as dense as the Earth."],"1238":["I guess so, but I don't think it captures the same holiday spirit as football does on Thanksgiving."],"1239":["I don't eat a lot of unhealthy foods."],"1240":["I haven't seen a Sumo match before, but I've heard they can be quite intense."],"1241":["I don't really have a favorite team, but I do enjoy watching Giants games."],"1242":["I don't think we should adopt that rule. People should be able to make their own choices about how they spend their time."],"1243":["Actually, I don't have any specific hobbies at the moment. I used to play guitar, but I haven't picked it up in a while. How about you?"],"1244":["Right, excessive drinking can have serious consequences on your health. It's really important to drink responsibly."],"1245":["I don't think so. The tea set was a family heirloom passed down from my great-grandmother, so I can't part with it."],"1246":["I don't think that qualifies as rapping at all. It's like they are just talking over a beat instead of actually showcasing talent. It's disappointing to see the direction that some music is going in."],"1247":["I don't think I could handle being in the water with sharks around."],"1248":["I don't doubt that. Organic produce usually tastes fresher and more flavorful than non-organic options. Have you ever considered trying some organic fruits or vegetables?"],"1249":["I don't think I want to relive those middle school memories anytime soon. It's a bit cringeworthy to think about now."],"1250":["That's understandable. Horror films can be really intense for some people. Have you ever seen a psychological thriller?"],"1251":["I don't mind the news updates, but the constant ads can get annoying."],"1252":["It didn't win an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, which many people thought it deserved."],"1253":["No, I'm not in her class. I'm in Mr. Smith's class."],"1254":["That is an interesting perspective. It really puts things into perspective."],"1255":["That's interesting, I didn't realize that detail about the custodian."],"1256":["No, I don't like football. I prefer basketball."],"1257":["Yes, but he ultimately decides to follow his dreams and go to a different college."],"1258":["Oh, I don't really like IKEA furniture."],"1259":["No, our company doesn't arrange transportation for international conferences. You will need to make your own transportation arrangements."],"1260":["I don't think I would feel comfortable talking with my friend in a crowded place. Maybe we could have the talk in a quiet park or caf\u00e9."],"1261":["He doesn't find Slinky Dog funny at all, but he loves Rex."],"1262":["Can't we pay online or use a transportation card instead?"],"1263":["Actually, they don't appear in the Olympics until 1998."],"1264":["Oh, you haven't seen the older version with Robert Redford then?"],"1265":[" Thank you so much for your kind words! I'm glad you enjoyed the book. I appreciate all the support from my readers. I don't think I would be where I am today without them."],"1266":["That's awesome! I'm sure you'll have a good chance of winning. Good luck!"],"1267":["You should definitely go see a show on Broadway. It's an amazing experience."],"1268":["I don't think we need that many exercise books. Let's stick to a more reasonable amount."],"1269":["I don't usually wear ripped jeans anyway, so that shouldn't be a problem."],"1270":["I don't have my I. D. number with me right now. Can I just leave my email address instead?"],"1271":["I don't think that's accurate. The Cleveland Browns actually had the worst record in the league that year with just one win and fifteen losses."],"1272":["Haha, don't worry, I won't push you too hard. We can start with lighter weights and focus on form and technique first. Let's do a few sets with Carpio to help build your core strength and stability. How does that sound?"],"1273":["I can't believe that! Bill Murray has seen a lot of movies, so for him to say that is quite a compliment."],"1274":["I can't decide. Let's just pick one and try it out."],"1275":["Smoking is prohibited in the park."],"1276":["I can't come out this evening, I promised my sister I would help her."],"1277":["Don't you just love the nostalgia it brings?"],"1278":["I can't believe how much time people spend watching shows and videos online. It's crazy."],"1279":["I know, it's crazy to think about how much Facebook has grown since then. It's definitely one of the most successful social media platforms."],"1280":["That's lucky! I hope you won't have to experience it anytime soon."],"1281":["No way, that's incredible! I can't believe the amount of information stored there."],"1282":["I'm afraid we can't deliver them any sooner than the quoted price."],"1283":["Have you tried talking to her about how her criticism makes you feel? Maybe she doesn't realize how much it affects you."],"1284":["I haven't been there either. But I have heard they have a really cool office space."],"1285":["They conducted studies that showed dogs can actually see color, just not as vibrantly as humans can."],"1286":["They are from Australia. Their music is a mix of psychedelic rock and pop, you should check them out sometime."],"1287":["And you can't forget about parking fees and maintenance costs, either."],"1288":["I wouldn't have thought that PS3s could be used for such important research. It's amazing what technology can do."],"1289":["I can't really think of one specific thing, but I learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration."],"1290":["I can't say that I have tried anything organic and sweet, but I have heard that organic honey is really delicious. Have you tried any organic sweets before?"],"1291":["That's a great observation! I think Morgan Freeman can easily pull off the serious God role while Jim Carrey can't be a comical God for sure. Their different comedic styles would definitely make for an interesting movie."],"1292":["I can't believe I never heard of that before. I really don't think I'm addicted to the web."],"1293":["She definitely doesn't have the comedic timing that Carrey does. I just couldn't see her as being married to Bruce, but then again, it is a comedy. Can't imagine anyone else in that role, can you?"],"1294":["I can't imagine there being a shortage of jobs related to the maple syrup industry in Vermont. It would definitely be a unique experience to work in that field."],"1295":["Can't you make an exception in this case? I am really desperate and in need of this medication."],"1296":["You too, have a great day!"],"1297":["No, I can't stand spending too much time online."],"1298":["Have you considered looking for jobs in that sector before?"],"1299":["I'm sure Olga can help you find some language exchange partners."],"1300":["Can't forget about Jennifer Tilly too."],"1301":["Oh, I can't believe Chris Froome is still competing at such a high level."],"1302":["Got it. So I can't go wrong if I just go down one level, right?"],"1303":["He wasn't in Django Unchained, it was Jamie Foxx who starred in that film."],"1304":["I'm not sure, but everyone has their own unique fears and triggers."],"1305":["Actually, they can't make 750 episodes of Pokemon if Tom Cruise is shilling for the cause of reducing motion smoothing."],"1306":["It can't be too serious if it's supposed to be funny."],"1307":["Oh really? I didn't know that. It sounds like a fun way to make the competition more exciting."],"1308":["No, they can't cancel the football match if it rains on Monday. They will just play in the rain."],"1309":["Yes, Baker Mayfield can't be underestimated. He has proven himself to be a strong and influential leader for the Browns."],"1310":["That's a good point. We can't continue relying on a finite resource like helium. Hopefully, scientists can make progress on fusion technology."],"1311":["That sounds interesting. I might have to check out some clips online. Thanks for telling me about him!"],"1312":["I don't think Armstrong has anything to worry about. He's already been to the moon and back!"],"1313":["I've actually never even heard of the book. Maybe I'll look into it based on your recommendation. Do you usually enjoy the books that get turned into movies?"],"1314":["I haven't read about that yet, but it definitely seems like a significant event in history."],"1315":["No, I did not know that! It's interesting how much we rely on external sources for certain things that other species can produce on their own. It really puts into perspective how interconnected we are with the world around us."],"1316":["No, I haven't traveled as much as I would like to."],"1317":["That's exciting news! I have not seen Carol in a while. Will your whole family be at the wedding?"],"1318":["Haven't you watched it yet?"],"1319":["I'm not sure yet. I might go for the pasta."],"1320":["No, I did not like it."],"1321":["I appreciate the invite, but I really can't tonight. I'm sorry."],"1322":["It's not uncommon for people to struggle with opening up emotionally."],"1323":["No, I don't know their blood types. I don't think most owners do."],"1324":["That's really disappointing. I didn't realize the lack of diversity in that category. It's definitely something that needs to change in the film industry."],"1325":["I haven't watched many comedy movies recently, but one that I really enjoyed was \"Superbad\". It had a good mix of humor and heartwarming moments."],"1326":["Sure, what didn't you like about it?"],"1327":["Yeah, it's amazing how different countries have laws to protect animals. It's really important for us to take care of our environment and the creatures that live in it."],"1328":["Yes, the movie \"Straight Outta Compton\" was released in 2015 and was a huge success, but I guess it's not really your type of film if you're not familiar with it."],"1329":["I have not heard of that single before, but it sounds like it would be a wild and energetic song. disco style dancing is definitely more my speed, I still struggle with more complicated dance moves like those in Wild Dances.\""],"1330":["That's a great idea! The original story is quite different from the movie, so it's definitely worth checking out."],"1331":["I haven't played the Harry Potter video games, but I have played LittleBigPlanet before. Stephen Fry is such a talented narrator, I'm sure he does make a lot of money for his work."],"1332":["I didn't realize Napster was one of the social networks before Facebook. It's interesting to see how much the business changed after that decision."],"1333":["I couldn't agree more. It's sad to see how genres get watered down over time. I feel like true music appreciation comes from exploring different styles and eras, not just sticking to what's popular right now."],"1334":["Oh, I see. Sorry, I must have missed that part of the conversation. Thank you for clarifying."],"1335":["I have not seen it."],"1336":["That's crazy! I don't think I could survive without Netflix, it has so much to offer."],"1337":["No, I do not listen to the radio. I prefer to listen to music on my phone."],"1338":["Please, don't leave. I haven't finished explaining yet."],"1339":["I enjoy some Disney movies, especially the classics like The Lion King and Aladdin. They never get old! What about you?"],"1340":["No, the weight lost is mostly water weight from sweating during the intense physical activity. It's not like they're leaving a trail of ice behind them on the rink."],"1341":["Great! And don't worry, we'll have a great time learning together. See you at six!"],"1342":["No, I didn't know that. But I do know he was a talented actor."],"1343":[" Actually, I do not. Why is it called the trunk?"],"1344":["I can't imagine being that close to an erupting volcano. It's incredibly dangerous."],"1345":["I'm sorry, but we are currently out of sesame chicken. Would you like to try something else from the menu?"],"1346":["Okay, I will make sure to check back with you in a few weeks to confirm. Thank you for your help."],"1347":["That sounds amazing! I can't believe I haven't watched it yet. I will definitely add it to my list of shows to watch. Thank you for the recommendation!"],"1348":["I have not watched many Alfred Hitchcock movies, but I have heard good things about them."],"1349":["Oh wow, that's a long time ago. I didn't realize it had been that long since the Cubs won."],"1350":["That's interesting! I haven't heard of a waterphone before, but it sounds perfect for creating a spooky atmosphere in horror films."],"1351":["I can't do it in three days, I need to do it all in one day."],"1352":["I wouldn't pick out a pit bull puppy, they're not really my style."],"1353":["Yes, he didn't take any payment for it. It was a gesture of respect for Michael's talent."],"1354":["It didn't take long to get an average degree in the USA, usually around 4 years."],"1355":["I didn't realize it had shut down that many times. That must cause a lot of issues for the country."],"1356":["Agreeing that Jones is a terrible person is one thing, but denying him a platform for his speech sets a dangerous precedent. Just because we may not agree with someone's views doesn't mean we should silence them. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be protected for everyone, even those we may not agree with."],"1357":["Did you not consider taking the bus or walking instead?"],"1358":["Yes, it's unfortunate that tigers are facing threats to their survival in the wild."],"1359":["I don't have a PC or an Apple computer, I have a Chromebook instead."],"1360":["I didn't know that. That's pretty smart of them to do that. It's interesting how companies protect their intellectual property."],"1361":["I suppose so. But I imagine it wasn't as glamorous as it seems from the outside. They probably didn't have much time for themselves."],"1362":["Oh, so it didn't cost less than $250 and it's not skinny either. Is it a new smartphone?"],"1363":["No, I didn't think Hans would kiss Anna. He was too suspicious from the beginning."],"1364":["Well, I didn't realize that the rate would double for single occupancy."],"1365":["I'm not sure, but maybe it has to do with the complexity of regrowing different body parts. And not all body parts have the same regenerative abilities."],"1366":["Yeah, it didn't quite measure up to this one."],"1367":["I have not seen A League of Their Own. I heard it's a tearjerker."],"1368":["That's terrible! I hope they find a cure soon."],"1369":["I didn't think of that, but you're right. It's definitely not a very ethical form of entertainment."],"1370":["Yes, it was a rivalry between East Coast and West Coast rappers back in the 1990s. It didn't end well for some of them."],"1371":["I didn't realize chocolate has been consumed for so many years."],"1372":["I didn't know that! And yes, I do like Tom Brady, he's a talented quarterback for sure."],"1373":["Yes, that's correct. Electric cars have been around for a long time, but they are gaining popularity now due to environmental concerns. Did you know that many major car manufacturers are now investing heavily in electric vehicle technology?"],"1374":["He didn't mention anything else."],"1375":["I didn't really enjoy it because I prefer the texture of a baked cheesecake."],"1376":["I agree. We didn't even get him a gift last year."],"1377":["I didn't know that. I'll switch over and see if it's more interesting. Thanks for the suggestion."],"1378":["No, this bus doesn't go to Zizhuyuan Park."],"1379":["I didn't know that! That's interesting."],"1380":["And they didn't just help with transportation, they also played a huge role in agriculture and warfare."],"1381":["That's great, but I didn't have that much in mind."],"1382":["That's a good point, they are definitely not the same thing."],"1383":["It definitely wasn't easy for him to become Batman."],"1384":["I didn't know that, that's fascinating!"],"1385":["I didn't realize that some of the original members are still performing. It's impressive that they have been able to continue their music career for so long."],"1386":["I don't think so. He seemed to always get himself into trouble with his adventurous spirit."],"1387":["It didn't meet my approval. Do you have a room with two twin beds instead?"],"1388":["Yes, he really has a diverse range of films in his repertoire."],"1389":["I'm sorry, we didn't have any non-smoking rooms available on that date."],"1390":["You should also avoid looking at the computer screen or any personal items on the desk. Avoid touching or moving anything without permission."],"1391":["I haven't really tried reading science fiction or fantasy before. Maybe I'll give it a shot."],"1392":["Sorry, I didn't mean that you look like Zayn Malik. But I bet you'd make a great Harry Styles girlfriend!"],"1393":["Exactly, panicking only worsens the situation. It's important not to react impulsively in times of market volatility."],"1394":["Don't blame me for your reckless driving. You were the one speeding down the road without paying attention."],"1395":["Great! I'll just make a fresh pot. Would you like it black or with cream and sugar?"],"1396":["You're welcome. And remember, don't give up easily. Keep practicing and you'll get better!"],"1397":["Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find the perfect gift for her. Just think about something thoughtful and meaningful that she'll appreciate."],"1398":["Well, let's not waste any more time here then. Let's go check out some street vendors instead."],"1399":["Oh really? I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing that information with me."],"1400":["That's totally fine! It's important to listen to your own preferences and needs when it comes to dietary choices."],"1401":["True, but that's not the end of it. Mrs. Fitzgerald's cat ran into the room and knocked over her new painting."],"1402":["I try to be cautious and read important details, but I don't trust everything I see online. It's always good to be aware of the risks."],"1403":["Don't worry, Eric. You can do it! Just keep practicing and you'll get the hang of it. Plus, speaking Chinese will definitely come in handy during your time in China."],"1404":["It's likely he did notice your tardiness."],"1405":["I don't know, I was just curious."],"1406":["You're welcome, but remember, tariffs don't always benefit all parties involved in trade."],"1407":["No problem, that must be the mistake. Thank you for checking again."],"1408":["Don't worry, just give it some time. If he doesn't call, then maybe it's not meant to be. Just focus on yourself and doing things that make you happy."],"1409":["Have you tried learning it from a professional dancer?"],"1410":["True, but it's never too late to start trying to quit. It's important to take care of our health."],"1411":["Honestly, I didn't really enjoy the ending as much as I thought I would."],"1412":["You should definitely get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. And if your symptoms get worse, don't hesitate to come back and see me."],"1413":["I don't eat much fish, but I do enjoy the occasional sushi night. It's good to know that there are different options for obtaining essential nutrients like Vitamin C. Do you have a favorite fish dish that you like to prepare at home?"],"1414":["That's surprising. I didn't realize that connection before. Do you think it's just a coincidence?"],"1415":["Oh, so it doesn't happen every year?"],"1416":["That's true, but I still don't feel very confident."],"1417":["But they don't realize that they actually have a lot in common despite their differences."],"1418":["Don't hesitate to tell me if you want me to adjust the pressure."],"1419":["Actually, Cadillac got its name from the French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac. He founded Detroit, Michigan where the Cadillac automobile company was eventually established."],"1420":["I don't think he's as good as Garfield though."],"1421":["That's a good idea.  It's important not to forget about the basic needs of those in need.  Hopefully, more communities will follow suit and provide solutions for the homeless population."],"1422":["It includes a gentle exfoliation, a calming mask, and a hydrating moisturizer. And don't worry, all of our products are organic and free of harsh chemicals."],"1423":["I don't think I've ever tried Pecan Pie before. Sounds delicious!"],"1424":["No, I haven't seen The Expanse yet, but I've heard great things about it. I'll have to add it to my watchlist. Thanks for the recommendation!"],"1425":["There aren't any specific Mars exploration games that I know of, but there are plenty of space-themed games out there to choose from."],"1426":["I don't know his exact age, but I would say he looks to be in his early thirties."],"1427":["I didn't know that! It's really concerning how easily false information spreads. I need to be more cautious about what I believe online."],"1428":["Actually, that's not correct. The Oscars and Emmys are two separate award shows, the Oscars are for movies and the Emmys are for television shows. So the Oscars weren't nominated for Emmys in 2013."],"1429":["No, Harry Styles is not in this movie. He is not an actor, he is a singer."],"1430":["Actually, I borrowed it from my brother."],"1431":["No, we don't want to spend that much. Do you have any cheaper options?"],"1432":["They are also great cars. The Ford Mustang is iconic and has a rich history in American automotive culture."],"1433":["You should! It's a fascinating read."],"1434":["There is no timer on this messaging app."],"1435":["We had been arguing a lot lately and she decided it was best to end things."],"1436":["That's great news, Mr. Hong. I'm happy to hear that the funds have arrived. Thank you for letting me know."],"1437":["That's not true. Women have been wearing pants in the US Senate for a long time. It's just a myth."],"1438":["Don't blame me for your reckless driving. If you had been paying attention, this could have been avoided."],"1439":["Yeah, it was definitely a dark moment in the film. Mal's character was haunted by her own thoughts and couldn't escape the cycle of the dream world. It was a tragic ending for her."],"1440":["It was a strategic move to give the Patriots a chance to get the ball back with more time on the clock. The Giants were trying to run down the clock and not give Brady a chance to make a comeback."],"1441":["It's a good question. I heard that a lot of the helium is being wasted on non-essential things like party balloons. If people were more aware of the scarcity of helium and its importance, maybe we could prevent it from running out completely."],"1442":["I haven't decided on our itinerary yet. I need to do some research before making any plans."],"1443":["I agree, he really brought a lot of charm to the role that I think was needed."],"1444":["That's fascinating. I had no idea about the influence of Hindu religion on Indian cuisine."],"1445":["I'm actually not sure. But I heard it was fake."],"1446":["No, I wasn't aware of that. It's fascinating to think about the possibility of contact with beings from other planets. Do you think they will ever reach out to us?"],"1447":["I didn't root for France actually, I was hoping for an underdog to win. France's team was just too strong."],"1448":["Yeah, I haven't really been into dramas lately either, but this one seems different."],"1449":["No, I don't want to go to the movie. I have plans with my friends."],"1450":["Wow, I didn't know that. Mel Blanc was so talented!"],"1451":["That's interesting! I had no idea they were so resourceful during wartime. It must have been a tough time for them, but music can really help lift spirits."],"1452":["I didn't know that. But I still found it really amusing."],"1453":["You weren't dancing with just anyone, were you?"],"1454":["No, I didn't particularly like any of the scenes."],"1455":["Wow, I didn't know that! It's surprising that they didn't notice that for four days."],"1456":["No, I'm not going home this year. I'll be celebrating Christmas here in China."],"1457":["It's no problem at all, happy to share my thoughts."],"1458":["Thank you, but I won't be able to make it today."],"1459":["Yeah, it's crazy how much the internet has changed since then. I can't imagine what it would be like without youtube and netflix now."],"1460":["It's still too small."],"1461":["Blond hair cannot be naturally found in darker-skinned populations."],"1462":["That's understandable. It's important to consider your family's needs before making a decision like that."],"1463":["I don't think it's crazy, it's important to support local artists and music industry."],"1464":["Actually, tigers are not domestic pets. They are wild animals and should not be kept as household pets."],"1465":["That sounds interesting! I'll have to try it sometime."],"1466":["No, his nemesis is actually his former friend."],"1467":["I don't think I've seen that one yet. Was it released recently?"],"1468":["I wouldn't necessarily say he's the best actor in the movie."],"1469":["There are actually many remedies for getting rid of skunk smell, but tomato sauce is not one of them."],"1470":["Definitely. He wasn't just lucky; he worked hard and made smart decisions along the way."],"1471":["That's interesting, but I don't think he actually used the term \"cyborg\" in his writing."],"1472":["Yes, I did hear about that! It's a fascinating concept to think about having a backup in case of a digital disaster."],"1473":["I don't think Google utilizing time limits is enough to address the issue."],"1474":["I don't think he's too worried about that. He feels like he did the right thing by standing up for himself and doesn't believe her friends will do anything to him."],"1475":["I don't think he was actually hunting the shark, he was just trying to protect the town."],"1476":["I don't believe shooting granny style necessarily looks stupid. In fact, some players have had great success with that technique."],"1477":["I don't believe that, that's a staggering amount of money!"],"1478":["I don't believe Steve Carell played Gru."],"1479":["I don't believe that Tim Tebow ended up playing for KISS' arena football team, but it would have been quite the unexpected combination."],"1480":["That's true, I don't think many people know that fact. It's interesting to learn about the different ways the bible has been viewed and used throughout history."],"1481":["I don't think it would take too long to read the whole series.

I am a huge fan of Disney movies, by far my favorite kind of film.

But using a helicopter is by far the most extravagant way I've heard of to dry grass for a sports event."],"2319":["By far the most surprising thing I have heard all day!"],"2320":["Bill Belichick is by far the most strategic coach in the league.

He was my favorite ballet dancer of all time."],"2357":["Actually, he was the best in the nutcracker. Undoubtedly, he was the most talented dancer in his class."],"2358":["Wow, I never knew that! I guess that would have been a motivation for him to start his own streaming service."],"2359":["Wow, that's interesting. I never knew that!"],"2360":["That's interesting!

My best friend actually works for Netflix and she always has the best movie recommendations."],"2361":["Yikes, that's quite a story! I heard that Netflix is one of the most popular streaming services out there nowadays."],"2362":["That's interesting, I'd say that's by far the best reason to start such a successful company!"],"2363":["Yes, they do, but by far, one of the most impressive things is that the Netherlands has completely banned wild animals in circuses to prevent their mistreatment."],"2364":["Not all countries have such strict animal protection laws, but Netherlands is by far one of the most animal-friendly places I've ever been to. They have strict regulations against animal cruelty and prioritize animal welfare in everything they do."],"2365":["Yes, they do! In fact, Netherlands is one of the most animal-friendly countries in the world. They have strict laws against animal cruelty and have many animal welfare organizations working to protect animals."],"2366":["Yes, they do!

It shows how much they truly care about animals."],"2367":["Yes, they do enjoy unique food combinations, but in terms of animal welfare, they have some of the strictest regulations in place. In fact, my best friend visited the Netherlands and said it was the best country for animal rights she had ever seen."],"2368":["Absolutely, Amazon's growth has been one of the most incredible success stories in the business world. It would be great to visit their headquarters and see it all in person one day."],"2369":["Yes, Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers in the world now. So many people use it for shopping, I would say it's one of the most popular e-commerce platforms out there."],"2370":["Yes, it is truly remarkable how Amazon has grown and expanded its reach over the years. I would like to learn more about its history and evolution. India is also a country with a rich postal history, despite not having Sunday delivery like the U.S. postal service."],"2371":["Would you mind telling me more about the history of Amazon and how it has grown over the years?"],"2372":["Definitely! Amazon's growth over the years is truly remarkable. The variety of services they offer is astonishing, from e-commerce to cloud computing.

It's always nice to have access to things you might not use very often."],"2379":["That sounds like a great idea! I think a library of things would be a great resource for people who want to try new hobbies without committing to buying expensive equipment."],"2380":["That's a great idea! The library of things concept is really catching on in some communities. My best friend lives in Portland, and they have the best library of things I've ever seen. They have everything from outdoor gear to kitchen appliances available for check out."],"2381":["That would be a great idea, especially for people who want to try out new hobbies without committing to buying expensive equipment."],"2382":["That would be one of the most convenient things to have access to. Sewing machines are usually quite expensive, so being able to borrow one would be really helpful."],"2383":["Don't you find it fascinating how these mind-bending theories challenge our perception of reality?"],"2384":["Oh, that's interesting. The theory of the one giant hologram sounds fascinating. Would you like to learn more about it?"],"2385":["Wow, that's interesting. The theory of only one electron in the universe is definitely one of the most mind-blowing scientific theories out there."],"2386":["Would you like to watch a documentary about those theories sometime? It would be really interesting to learn more about them."],"2387":["Yeah, the hologram theory is interesting, but the idea of only one electron in the universe just blows my mind. It's like the ultimate simplification of everything, don't you think?"],"2388":["I would undoubtedly agree with you there. Some things just don't deserve all the hype, don't you think?"],"2389":["I agree, neither Gangnam Style nor Baby are my cup of tea. But it's interesting to see how much impact they both had on YouTube."],"2390":["Yeah, Gangnam style really did have a huge impact. It's crazy how some videos can become so popular, while others are the most disliked."],"2391":["I would like to invite you to join me in discovering some underrated gems on YouTube instead."],"2392":["I would strongly advise against listening to it again, even for a laugh. It's the worst music video I've ever seen."],"2393":["You too! Take care and see you soon!"],"2394":["You too! Take care!"],"2395":["Would you like to grab lunch together sometime next week?"],"2396":["You too, B! Let's catch up again soon!"],"2397":["Likewise! You have a fantastic day as well!"],"2398":["That's definitely concerning. It's by far the easiest way for kids to connect with their friends, but also by far the most dangerous."],"2399":["That's not the best idea. It would be better for them to wait until they are actually 13 before joining social media platforms."],"2400":["That's crazy! I think that's the best way for parents to keep an eye on their kids' online activity."],"2401":["That's concerning. I wouldn't have thought parents would allow that."],"2402":["It would be best for young kids to wait until they are older before joining social media platforms like Facebook. It's concerning how easy it is for them to lie about their age."],"2403":["I think it's because they are seen as the best-dressed couple in the world right now. Would you like to see their latest outfits?"],"2404":["If I had the chance, I would love to attend the royal wedding."],"2405":["I don't really follow them either. It's just not my cup of tea."],"2406":["I wouldn't be interested in following them either, but I guess some people really enjoy keeping up with royal news."],"2407":["Actually, Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are one of the most famous couples in the world, with a wedding that was watched by millions of people around the globe."],"2408":["and now none of the other news organizations can compare to the Post's coverage."],"2409":["I don't think any other newspaper faced as much pressure from the government as The Washington Post did during that time."],"2410":["That's intense. The Post didn't back down though, they continued to investigate and publish the truth."],"2411":["That's insane! The Washington Post is one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Would you mind sharing more details about how Nixon attempted to ban them?"],"2412":["Wow, that's one of the harshest actions a president has taken against a newspaper. Would you mind sharing more details about how the Post handled the situation?"],"2413":["South Park has some of the best humor on television. It's definitely my favorite animated show."],"2414":["It's true, South Park is one of the funniest animated shows out there. I think it's definitely the most controversial of all the animated shows on TV right now."],"2415":["Never have I seen such a perfect blend of satire and humor like South Park. Don't you think it's impressive how they manage to stay relevant for so many seasons?"],"2416":["Would you like to watch an episode of South Park together sometime? It would be fun!"],"2417":["That's cool! It shows that even in the world of animation, there's mutual respect by far. Would you like to invite some friends over to have a South Park marathon sometime?"],"2418":["I know, it's definitely a unique concept for a store. And the prices are probably marked up a lot too because of the novelty factor."],"2419":["I don't think it would be a popular shopping spot for everyone, but for some, it might be like a treasure hunt."],"2420":["I know right, it's kind of a strange concept. But some people find hidden gems there. And apparently, the store has the most unique collection of lost items in the world, according to travelers who have visited."],"2421":["I can understand that sentiment. It would feel like taking advantage of someone else's misfortune. It's definitely a unique concept for a store, that's for sure."],"2422":["I don't think they would mind, considering the unique items they have in stock. It might be a fun treasure hunt to see if you can find any of those vintage Apple pieces!"],"2423":["That's interesting. I didn't even know that was possible. Jupiter's storms must be incredibly powerful."],"2424":["NOT ONLY can they be picked up by AM radio, BUT they could also potentially cause interference with communication systems on Earth."],"2425":["That is not only fascinating, but also quite impressive. The power of those storms must be incredible."],"2426":["That is one of the most interesting facts I've heard all day! Jupiter is truly a fascinating planet. Would you like to learn more about it?"],"2427":["That is fascinating!  I don't believe I've ever heard of a planet's storms being picked up on Earth's radio waves before. The universe is truly amazing."],"2428":["Neither Mario games nor any other franchise can compare to the success of Call of Duty in terms of sales."],"2429":["I don't think any other game franchise has reached that level of success. Would you like to try playing one of the Call of Duty games with me sometime?"],"2430":["Yes, it's impressive how popular Call of Duty is. Mario games are fun too, but they don't have the slightest chance of surpassing the sales of Call of Duty."],"2431":["It would be interesting to see the breakdown of sales for each game in the Call of Duty series."],"2432":["Absolutely! Call of Duty is undoubtedly one of the most successful game franchises in history. Mario games are timeless classics, but the sales of Call of Duty games are significantly higher."],"2433":["I didn't know that! I find the original version with the American cast to be the best of all the versions I've seen."],"2434":["No, I didn't know that! That's interesting. I imagine it must have been challenging to recreate the same dynamic and humor."],"2435":["I didn't know that! I would have thought it would be difficult to recreate the same dynamic in a different setting. It's interesting how certain shows can have such a unique feel that's hard to replicate."],"2436":["I did not know that! It's interesting how some shows don't translate well to other cultures. It would be fascinating to see how they adapted it for a UK audience."],"2437":["I didn't know that! I find That 70's Show to be one of the funniest sitcoms I've ever watched. It's definitely one of the best comedies on Netflix by far."],"2438":["By far the worst character in the whole film, I never want to see her again."],"2439":["Definitely, she was one of the worst villains in the movie. Would you say she was the meanest character in the entire series?"],"2440":["Would you like to watch it again sometime?"],"2441":["Regina was by far the worst character in the entire film."],"2442":["She was definitely one of the most entertaining characters in the film, not only adding tension but also humor to the story."],"2443":["Yes, it's interesting how those masks can have different meanings depending on the context. I would love to learn more about the history behind them."],"2444":["By far, his performance in that drama series was the highlight of his career. He would always captivate the audience with his range of emotions."],"2445":["I know, it's interesting how those masks can have different meanings. I would like to learn more about the history behind theater symbols."],"2446":["I believe the tragedy mask represents the most intense emotions, while the comedy mask symbolizes the light-hearted side of theater. It's fascinating how such simple symbols can convey so much meaning."],"2447":["Wouldn't you say he is the best actor of our generation, with such a versatile range of talent?"],"2448":["I highly doubt the Library of Alexandria could even contain the faintest fraction of that amount of data."],"2449":["Yeah, the amount of data stored on the internet is mind-blowing. It's hard to imagine a physical copy of it all, even in the legendary Library of Alexandria."],"2450":["I don't think the Library of Alexandria could possibly save all that information. It definitely sounds like a tall tale."],"2451":["It's definitely one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard of."],"2452":["Undoubtedly, that would not have been a feasible task back then."],"2453":["It's actually the funniest movie I've ever seen, with the most ridiculous plot twists and characters."],"2454":["It's definitely one of the funniest Christmas movies out there, don't you think?"],"2455":["It's definitely one of the best Christmas movies out there. The comedy is timeless."],"2456":["Would you mind watching it with us next year?"],"2457":["It's one of the best Christmas movies ever made. The humor in it is so timeless."],"2458":["I think he just likes to stir up controversy and say things that shock people. He would never say things if he didn't want a reaction."],"2459":["It's true. It would be very strange if we actually created such a devastating disease on purpose. It doesn't make sense."],"2460":["I think it's more about the conspiracy theories he believes in rather than actual logic. Kanye West definitely has some interesting beliefs."],"2461":["I think he believes that it was created to target certain populations or for some other agenda. I don't necessarily agree with his beliefs, but that's just Kanye being Kanye."],"2462":["You have a point. I think Kanye West is by far the most controversial and enigmatic celebrity in the music industry. He strongly believes in expressing his thoughts and ideas without hesitation. I would say he is one of the most outspoken artists in the world."],"2463":["Would you say this is Jim Carrey's most iconic role?"],"2464":["Would you like to watch the sequel to this movie to see if Jim Carrey's performance has improved?"],"2465":["I would definitely say that this movie played a huge role in launching Jim Carrey's career. He was really able to showcase his comedic talent in a way that captivated audiences."],"2466":["I think this was definitely one of the best comedies he has been in. Would you mind checking to see what other superlatives are used to describe his performances in movies?"],"2467":["I would say \"The Truman Show\" was his breakout movie, wouldn't you agree?"],"2468":["That sounds fun! I bet watching Greek dramas live would be the best experience, especially with your background in Classics."],"2469":["That sounds like a great idea! I would definitely be interested in watching those as well."],"2470":["Oh, that sounds cool. I bet those park performances would be the best live shows ever with all your knowledge on Greek dramas!"],"2471":["That sounds interesting! I would definitely join you for that, I've always wanted to experience more cultural events like that."],"2472":["That's cool, I didn't even know you were into classics. Sounds like you would enjoy it a lot!"],"2473":["Yes, he did work on West Side Story! The musical is considered one of the best of all time, with unforgettable songs and choreography. It would be amazing to see it live on Broadway!"],"2474":["Yes, he did work on West Side Story! It's considered one of his most iconic works. The musical is said to be even more powerful than the movie, I would love to see it on Broadway someday."],"2475":["Yes, that's right! It's one of the most famous musicals ever made. You should definitely try to see it live someday, the choreography is absolutely breathtaking!"],"2476":["Yes, he did! I would highly recommend seeing the musical if you enjoyed the movie. It's a classic!"],"2477":["Yes, he did! The musical is considered one of his best works. The choreography in that show is absolutely stunning, definitely worth seeing live if you ever get the chance. It's a classic!"],"2478":["That was definitely one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a superhero movie."],"2479":["I agree, it was definitely a bit anticlimactic for such a big character death. Lex Luthor is not only a brilliant antagonist but also a cunning one, so I wouldn't be surprised if he comes back for revenge in the next movie."],"2480":["Neither Batman's grief nor Lex Luthor's imprisonment ended the movie conclusively. Not everyone believes major superheroes can be killed off without consequence."],"2481":["I agree, they definitely left it open for a sequel. It was like the slightest hint of a potential return for Superman."],"2482":["I agree. It definitely left a lot of loose ends that could set up for a more powerful sequel. Lex Luthor's thirst for revenge is by far the most intriguing aspect of the film. I would have liked to see a more definite conclusion for his character."],"2483":["Oh yes, I have heard about that book! I've heard it's a really interesting read. I'll definitely have to check it out."],"2484":["I haven't heard about it, but I'm sure it's the most exciting book release of the year! I definitely want to check it out now."],"2485":["That sounds interesting, I would love to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!"],"2486":["Oh, that sounds interesting! I heard it's the best book she's ever written. I'll have to check it out. And don't forget to bring your sunglasses, it's going to be the brightest day we've had in weeks."],"2487":["Oh yes, I have heard of it! It's one of the most highly anticipated books of the year. I would love to get my hands on a copy and read it."],"2488":["Well, I don't think IQ is the only factor that determines chess skills. It's all about strategy and practice. Plus, it could be a fun challenge!"],"2489":["Neither do I have the time to commit to such a rigorous training schedule required to excel in chess."],"2490":["Well, we can still try our best and strive for excellence in the game. Who knows, we might discover our hidden talent for chess!"],"2491":["True, but it's still one of the most mentally stimulating games out there. It's a great way to improve critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities."],"2492":["Well, I wouldn't have guessed that! I guess we can still give it a shot and see how we do. Would you be up for the challenge?"],"2493":["Yeah, not all country music fans appreciated that stunt, but Bobby Bones still has a huge following. His show is the most popular country music radio show in the US."],"2494":["Yeah, by far Howard Stern is more controversial than Bobby Bones. Stern wouldn't have made that kind of mistake."],"2495":["Yeah, he definitely stirred up some controversy with that stunt! But I still think he's one of the funniest radio hosts out there, even if he's not the most traditional."],"2496":["Yeah, he definitely got a lot of criticism for that stunt. It's interesting how some radio hosts push the boundaries to get attention. Have you heard any other outrageous stories about radio hosts?"],"2497":["Yeah, he really pushed the boundaries with that stunt. My best friend is actually one of the biggest Bobby Bones fans, she never misses his show. Would you like to invite her to listen with us sometime?"],"2498":["He was one of the earliest actors to play Batman on television."],"2499":["He was the actor who played Batman in the 1960s TV series, and many people consider him to be the best Batman portrayal."],"2500":["He was the actor who played Batman in the 1960s TV series. Neither do I know much about him."],"2501":["He was one of the best Batman actors, he played the role in the 1960s tv series."],"2502":["Adam West is best known for his portrayal of Batman in the 1960s television series. He is considered one of the most iconic actors to have played the superhero role."],"2503":["Indeed, they are much more durable now. Car trunks are by far the most convenient feature of modern cars."],"2504":["Yes, it's definitely a much more practical design now. And the convenience of having a trunk in cars is one of the best features in my opinion."],"2505":["Yes, they have definitely come a long way. The evolution of car designs has by far been the most fascinating aspect of the automotive industry."],"2506":["Yes, that would have been quite inconvenient. The evolution of cars and the automotive industry is truly fascinating. The innovations and advancements have definitely shaped the way we live our lives today."],"2507":["It would be one of the best inventions to have a car with a wooden trunk, though."],"2508":["Never have I heard of such a popular attraction with such a unique way of experiencing the views."],"2509":["Actually, you can also reach the Skywalk by driving there. But, it can get quite crowded, so it's best to book in advance if you would like to visit."],"2510":["Actually, you can also get there by bus from Las Vegas. Would you like to invite me to go on the skywalk with you next weekend?"],"2511":["That's correct, the Skywalk is indeed a popular attraction and there is usually a long line of eager visitors waiting for their turn to experience the unique view it offers."],"2512":["Not all visitors to the Grand Canyon get the chance to experience the Skywalk or a helicopter tour, so it can be quite exclusive."],"2513":["That's true, he could have had a different path if he had chosen differently. But Kanye is one of the most influential figures in the music industry."],"2514":["He is definitely one of the most controversial figures in the music industry."],"2515":["Interesting, I did not know that about Rapper Big Sean. It's always hard to know what the best decision is in those situations."],"2516":["If he had taken that scholarship, he probably would have had a very different career."],"2517":["That's true, Big Sean would have had a different path if he had made that choice."],"2518":["Wow, that is quite ironic. It seems like he has a bit of a sense of humor about himself."],"2519":["That's true. It was the slightest hint of what was to come."],"2520":["Would you mind handing me that pen over there? Thanks. And yeah, Kanye definitely has his moments."],"2521":["That skit was one of the best SNL moments in recent memory. It would be great if more celebrities could laugh at themselves like that."],"2522":["That's actually one of the funniest skits I've ever seen. It's definitely one of the best moments from his career."],"2523":["It must have been incredibly difficult for the families, not all of them received closure after the trial either. It's such a heartbreaking situation for everyone involved. My best friend's cousin was actually at the location during the attack, and the trauma still affects him to this day."],"2524":["Yeah, it's definitely a difficult situation for all involved. The fact that she would lie about helping him really shows the extent of her fear. I think her fear would have been overwhelming in that situation."],"2525":["I agree, it must have been incredibly difficult for everyone involved in the trial. I can't even imagine the emotional toll it must have taken on them. It's a tragic situation all around."],"2526":["One of the most difficult situations to be in, not only for the families but also for the victims themselves. It must have been incredibly traumatic to have to relive such a horrifying experience in court. It's not only emotionally draining but also mentally exhausting to go through that process."],"2527":["Yes, it must have been a truly horrific experience for all involved. The emotional toll that must have taken on everyone is unimaginable. The fact that she knew about his plans for an ISIS attack and didn't come forward is just mind-boggling. The families of the victims deserve closure and justice, and her unwillingness to act is not a valid excuse."],"2528":["I heard she would never let anyone get away with breaking the rules."],"2529":["I wouldn't want to be in their shoes, facing the faintest chance of passing after that. She's definitely the strictest dean I've ever seen."],"2530":["She's definitely the strictest teacher at the school."],"2531":["I heard she's the strictest instructor on campus, never allowing any exceptions."],"2532":["That must have been the strictest punishment ever. It would be impossible to pass if you broke that rule."],"2533":["I heard it was because the team needed to meet the salary cap, it was a strategic move!"],"2534":["Yeah, it's crazy to think about. I would never have imagined a professional athlete being traded for just $1."],"2535":["Yeah, it was definitely a unique situation for sure, but that player went on to have a successful career after that trade."],"2536":["He was actually considered the worst player in the league at the time, so it makes sense."],"2537":["He was considered the faintest contributor to the team, it's quite shocking. Would you ever play hockey professionally?"],"2538":["No, I haven't watched any games with him. But my best friend's grandfather saw Babe Ruth play at Yankee Stadium once. It must have been an incredible experience."],"2539":["No, I haven't watched games with him. I wouldn't have missed it for the world! But I have seen footage of his games and he was truly a remarkable player."],"2540":["No, I haven't watched games with Babe Ruth. But if I could travel back in time, I would definitely want to watch him play."],"2541":["I haven't watched any games with Babe Ruth, but I have seen highlights of his legendary career. He was one of the greatest baseball players of all time."],"2542":["No, I haven't watched any games with him, but I've heard that Babe Ruth was one of the greatest baseball players of all time."],"2543":["I don't believe Iphone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear deterrent, that is hard to imagine."],"2544":["Not all technology advancements are necessarily a good thing, though. Some people still prefer the simplicity of the old rotary phones."],"2545":["Not only does an iPhone have more computing power than the entire US nuclear deterrent, but it also fits in the palm of your hand. It's truly incredible how far technology has come."],"2546":["Yes, it's definitely mind-blowing how technology has progressed. My best friend actually works in the tech industry and he always tells me about the latest advancements."],"2547":["It's true, technology has come so far. My best friend always has the latest gadgets, she is the most tech-savvy person I know."],"2548":["Thanks for the heads up. I'll definitely keep an eye out for SJ's performance."],"2549":["He sounds adorable! I can't wait to see him in action."],"2550":["Oh, I can't wait to see it then. He must be one of the best child actors I've ever seen."],"2551":["I can't wait to see him in action. He sounds like the most adorable child actor of all time."],"2552":["He sounds adorable! I can't wait to see it. Who would you say is the best actor in the film?"],"2553":["If I had the chance, I would definitely invite Scarlett Johansson to join us."],"2554":["Absolutely, let's have the best night ever!"],"2555":["I think Scarlett Johansson is the most beautiful actress in Hollywood."],"2556":["I would strongly agree with that plan. It sounds like a fantastic way to celebrate."],"2557":["Would you strongly consider seeing a movie with Scarlett Johansson in it for your birthday? She is easily the most talented actress in Hollywood by far."],"2558":["Well, it's surprising that any percentage of people don't take the time to read the terms before making a purchase online. It's always important to know what you're agreeing to."],"2559":["I don't believe many people actually read the terms and conditions anyway."],"2560":["I never read those terms and conditions, neither does anyone else in my family."],"2561":["I never read those terms and conditions either, but I should start being more cautious!"],"2562":["Yeah, that's definitely surprising. I guess not everyone takes the time to read the terms and conditions thoroughly."],"2563":["That's impressive, \"With or Without You\" is definitely one of the most emotional songs U2 has ever made."],"2564":["That performance was definitely the best one by far, their routine was flawless."],"2565":["I don't remember seeing that post on Facebook."],"2566":["I would have loved to see that performance, it sounds amazing!"],"2567":["That's great! I heard it was one of the best routines in the competition."],"2568":["That sounds like it could be one of the easiest jobs out there. Do they have any requirements for being a tagger?"],"2569":["That would undoubtedly be an interesting job opportunity."],"2570":["That sounds like an interesting job, I would definitely like to learn more about it."],"2571":["That sounds like the easiest job ever. I would have never thought it could be so simple."],"2572":["That sounds like the easiest job in the world. I would definitely do that if I had the chance."],"2573":["I would highly recommend watching it, then."],"2574":["I don't think there's a movie better than Rocky, in my opinion."],"2575":["I can't say I'm a fan of Rocky."],"2576":["I have neither seen the movie Rocky nor heard much about it."],"2577":["It sounds like Ant-Man and the Wasp is probably one of the best superhero movies out there, then."],"2578":["yeah, but she's known as the \"most feared assassin in the world\"."],"2579":["None of the other crime syndicates can compare to the Russian one in terms of ruthlessness and power. Have you heard any rumors about their latest operation?"],"2580":["Yes, but she is by far the most feared in the criminal underworld."],"2581":["Would you believe that Baba Yaga is actually based on a folklore character from Russian mythology?"],"2582":["Baba Yaga is one of the most mysterious and fearsome figures in Russian folklore."],"2583":["It would be difficult to imagine anyone else in that role, he truly brought the character to life with his performance."],"2584":["Yes, he did an amazing job portraying Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network\"."],"2585":["Not only did Jesse Eisenberg nail the part, but his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg was also very compelling. Don't you think his performance was worthy of an award?"],"2586":["He definitely did! In my opinion, he was by far the best choice for that role."],"2587":["He did! He's one of the best actors in Hollywood."],"2588":["I agree, she is the most hostile character in the book"],"2589":["She is the rudest person I've ever encountered."],"2590":["If we were in her situation, we would probably act the same way."],"2591":["Yeah, she is definitely the most ungrateful character in the entire story."],"2592":["She's definitely one of the most ungrateful characters I've ever seen in a book"],"2593":["It would be interesting to see if she could hold her own against top male players."],"2594":["Wow, it sounds like she and her sister were by far the best doubles team around at that time!"],"2595":["Wow, I would like to see some footage of that match! Do you think you could find it online?"],"2596":["Wow, playing against males and still being unstoppable with her sister in 1998! That must have been an incredible experience for them."],"2597":["Wow, I would have loved to see that match! It must have been such an amazing experience to witness the best player of all time playing alongside her sister."],"2598":["I would like to see that movie. Sounds interesting."],"2599":["That scene was by far the most emotional moment in the entire film. It really showed the depth of their friendship."],"2600":["Would you mind telling me more about that movie? I'm intrigued by the plot."],"2601":["That's interesting. I would have never guessed that they split up in the movie."],"2602":["Sounds interesting, but that is definitely not the best movie plot I've ever heard."],"2603":["They are requiring more paperwork and documentation for approval to work from home. It seems like they are trying to discourage telecommuting altogether."],"2604":["The dept. of education is requiring all virtual meetings to be scheduled during normal working hours. By far, this is the most inconvenient change they've implemented. Would you like to discuss possible solutions to this issue?"],"2605":["They are requiring more documentation and approval processes, which would undoubtedly slow down the telecommuting approval process."],"2606":["Not only are they limiting the number of days people can work from home, but they are also requiring more documentation and oversight for telecommuting requests. It's not just frustrating, but it's also a step backward in promoting work-life balance."],"2607":["The department of education is requiring in-person meetings every week, which defeats the purpose of telecommuting. There are various obstacles to overcome."],"2608":["Wow, Judge Judy is by far the highest paid celebrity I've heard of so far."],"2609":["Wow, that's incredible! She must be very talented. Have you ever seen any of her shows?"],"2610":["That's impressive! If I ever met a celebrity, I would probably be starstruck."],"2611":["Wow, that's impressive. I would definitely be starstruck meeting Judge Judy!"],"2612":["Wow, that's impressive. Judge Judy is definitely a successful woman."],"2613":["It's amazing how quickly technology advances. The invention of cars really revolutionized transportation. And now, with electric cars becoming more popular, who knows what the future holds for transportation!"],"2614":["Not only did cars revolutionize transportation, but they also completely changed the way society functions. It's incredible how quickly things can change in just a few decades."],"2615":["Yes, it's fascinating how quickly technology can change our way of life. The transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles must have been such a significant moment in history."],"2616":["Yes, it's amazing how quickly technology progresses. In just a short amount of time, cars have revolutionized transportation. It's definitely one of the most significant advancements in modern history."],"2617":["Absolutely, it's amazing to see how far technology has come in such a short amount of time. I can't imagine living in a time without cars, can you?"],"2618":["Would you recommend attending a game in person to really experience the atmosphere?"],"2619":["Neither do I watch it much. That is crazy about the cost of those flags! My best friend actually attended the Super Bowl once. Would you ever go to a game if you had the chance?"],"2620":["Wow, that's crazy! I didn't know it cost that much to make those giant flags. My best friend is actually a seamstress and she could probably make a flag like that. She's incredible with a needle and thread."],"2621":[" That is incredible! Those giant flags must be by far the most expensive decorations at the stadium."],"2622":["That's insane. I didn't realize they cost that much. It must be quite a process to create something so huge and colorful. I would love to see one up close someday."],"2623":["I think it was probably for safety reasons. Soldiers in fatigues could have potentially caused a disturbance or been a security risk if they were allowed to enter certain areas. \n\nMy best friend would agree with you on that point. She's always been very cautious when it comes to security measures."],"2624":["Would you mind sharing your thoughts first?"],"2625":["I think they didn't want the soldiers to come in because they were concerned about safety and potential disruptions. But I would like to invite you to share your thoughts on the matter."],"2626":["I would imagine they didn't want the soldiers to come in because it could pose a security risk."],"2627":["I think they didn't want the soldiers to come in because they were worried about keeping a sanitary environment. Soldiers in uniform may have been dirty and could have brought contaminants into the building. Plus, it was probably more efficient to serve them in the convenience of their vehicles. What do you think?"],"2628":["That must have been quite an inconvenience for whoever was in charge at the time. I wonder which President had the most challenging living situation during their time in office."],"2629":["I wouldn't mind being the President with a guest house while the White House was being rebuilt. Sounds like a historic experience."],"2630":["Some Presidents probably wouldn't have been too happy about that. It's interesting to think about the history of the White House and all the events that have taken place there."],"2631":["That's interesting. I would have loved to see what the White House looked like back then. It must have been quite different from what it is now."],"2632":["True, I bet that was a tough time for whoever was President then. I can't imagine being without a place to reside, even temporarily. "],"2633":["Neither Netflix nor Amazon would have a good reason to own IMDB if it's all just a giant hologram anyway."],"2634":["Yeah, by far the craziest theory I've heard. I wouldn't want to live in a hologram, that's for sure."],"2635":["Haha, I know right? Elon Musk would probably tell you to just keep working hard and maybe one day you can afford rent in the hologram universe."],"2636":["I know, the concept is mind-boggling. He's always coming up with the most far-fetched theories. But the idea of the universe being a hologram is definitely the faintest explanation I've ever heard for existence."],"2637":["By far the most mind-boggling theory I've ever heard. Elon undoubtedly comes up with some interesting ideas, doesn't he? But personally, I prefer the idea of solid ground beneath my feet."],"2638":["Neither did I. That's really amazing."],"2639":["I had no idea, that's really impressive. It's amazing how technology has advanced so much."],"2640":["None of the bowlers I know would have ever guessed that. It's incredible how technology has advanced."],"2641":["Wow, really? That's incredible! My best friend works in the tech industry and he would love to hear that."],"2642":["Wow, that's the faintest clue I had about technology! It's crazy how far we've come."],"2643":["Yes, it's fascinating to see how different historical figures interpreted the Bible in their own unique ways. It really shows the diversity of perspectives on such an influential text."],"2644":["Yes, it's fascinating to see how different interpretations and translations can shape our understanding of such ancient texts. I would like to invite you to join me in exploring more about this topic in the future."],"2645":["It shows how interpretations of the Bible can evolve and change over time. If people today were to rewrite the Bible, would it still have the same impact on society?"],"2646":["Yes, the Bible has definitely evolved over time. It's fascinating to see how different Presidents interpreted and utilized it in their own ways. It really shows the diversity of beliefs and perspectives on such a significant text in history."],"2647":["Yes, it would be fascinating to learn more about the different interpretations of the Bible by these Presidents. It would have been interesting to have been a fly on the wall during those discussions."],"2648":["That's true. The two major parties have dominated the political landscape for many years."],"2649":["That's true. The Green Party, for example, has the faintest chance of winning a national election in the U.S."],"2650":["By far, the two-party system in the United States has been dominant for over a century."],"2651":["That's true, the two major parties have always dominated the political scene in the US."],"2652":["Yes, it's quite rare for other parties to gain significant attention in the media."],"2653":["By far, engineers definitely make more in lifetime earnings than NFL players."],"2654":["Yeah, I didn't know that. I wouldn't have guessed that engineers could earn more than NFL players in their lifetime."],"2655":["Yeah, I did know that. Engineers have a lot of opportunities for advancement in their field, unlike NFL players whose careers are often short-lived. It would have been interesting to see what career path I would have pursued if I hadn't chosen engineering."],"2656":["I didn't know that. Engineers must have the best job security and salary potential then."],"2657":["I didn't know that! Engineers definitely have a stable and lucrative career, that's interesting."],"2658":["One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen! If you haven't watched it, you should definitely give it a try."],"2659":["I liked the special effects the most, they were the coolest I've ever seen."],"2660":["Iron Man is definitely one of the most action-packed and entertaining superhero movies I have ever seen."],"2661":["I would definitely say that the action scenes were the most thrilling I've ever seen in a superhero movie."],"2662":["Iron Man is the best movie I have ever watched in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Would you like to come over and watch it again with me?"],"2663":["It would be an 11!"],"2664":["Honestly, it would be not a good idea to rate this movie or any other movie without watching it first."],"2665":["I wouldn't have rated it very high, maybe a 5."],"2666":["He's not just any Agent, he's the best Agent who represents S.H.I.E.L.D."],"2667":["I would rate this movie a 9. It's one of the best superhero films I've seen in recent years."],"2668":["This is the best document I have ever created."],"2669":["It's undoubtedly the most important document I've ever written."],"2670":["I don't believe my document changed."],"2671":["Would you mind taking a look and giving me some feedback on it?"],"2672":["It's actually one of the most thrilling documentaries I've ever seen."],"2673":["Oh, I see. Are you planning on doing an internship soon to gain more experience in your field? It can really help set you up for success in the future."],"2674":["Wow, that's impressive! You seem like you're really dedicated to your studies."],"2675":["Didn't you say you never did an internship before?"],"2676":["You're welcome! That's great. Have you chosen a specialization yet, or are you still exploring your options?"],"2677":["Wow, that's amazing! You must be one of the best students in your program!"],"2678":["That's a good point. I guess I wouldn't either, especially if it's that dangerous."],"2679":["You're right, my best friend. Safety first!"],"2680":["You're right, the risk wouldn't be worth it. That mega shark is by far the most terrifying creature in the ocean."],"2681":["Very true, safety first! But hey, if they offered a million dollars, would you consider it then?"],"2682":["You make a good point. It wouldn't be worth it if I ended up as shark food, huh?"],"2683":["Yeah, it would be interesting to know how they convinced other schools to join in. Zuckerberg must have been a charismatic guy to sell his idea like that. It's crazy to think about how successful Facebook has become since then."],"2684":["By far, they had a brilliant idea and executed it perfectly. Would you like to know more about how they convinced other schools to join? None of the other social media platforms have been able to reach the success that Facebook has achieved."],"2685":["Not only did they target universities, but they also allowed students to connect and share information easily. It was a smart move on their part to not only focus on one school, but to expand quickly to other campuses as well."],"2686":["Yeah, it's pretty fascinating how they were able to expand it so quickly. I think it was the exclusivity and the hype surrounding it that really drew people in. The fact that it was limited to certain schools at first probably made it seem even more desirable."],"2687":["I think they offered exclusive access to those other schools as a way to get them on board. It was a very smart move on their part. There were probably some schools that were hesitant at first, but once they saw the success at Harvard, they didn't want to be left out. It's crazy to think how quickly Facebook grew from there. One of the fastest growing social media platforms in history!"],"2688":["Yes, I have! It was by far the most creative and entertaining voting event I've ever seen."],"2689":["Yes, I have! It was voted the weirdest city in America."],"2690":["No, I haven't heard about the funny vote in Austin, Texas. What happened?"],"2691":["I have not heard of that. What happened in Austin Texas?"],"2692":["Yes, I have. It was the best organized and most successful voter drive in the history of the city. Wouldn't it be great if more cities followed their example?"],"2693":["I don't really enjoy NWA's music, but I do agree that they were influential in the hip-hop world. Their impact is undeniable, even if their style wasn't my personal favorite."],"2694":["NWA's Straight Outta Compton is definitely one of the most influential rap albums of all time.  Dr. Dre is a legend!  And let's not forget about Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" which is considered one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time."],"2695":["I agree with you on NWA. They were so influential and their impact on the genre is undeniable. Not only did they pave the way for future artists, but they also brought attention to important social issues."],"2696":["NWA's Straight Outta Compton is by far a classic and their impact on rap music cannot be denied. They revolutionized the genre in a way that would not be seen again for years."],"2697":["I agree with you, NWA's Straight Outta Compton is definitely a classic. Dr. Dre's production on that album is unreal. It's truly the faintest possibility that we'll ever see a group like that again in hip-hop."],"2698":["That is fascinating. It's crazy to think about how complex and diverse the animal kingdom is."],"2699":["That's fascinating. It's incredible to think about the variety of ways animals have adapted to survive over millions of years."],"2700":["That's interesting. So hiccups are not a modern problem, they have been around for a long time."],"2701":["That's fascinating! I didn't realize the connection between hiccups and the evolution of lungs and gills in animals. It's not a thought I've ever had before."],"2702":["By far the most fascinating thing about wolves is how they cooperate and work together in a pack."],"2703":["Yeah, I heard about that. It's such a complicated situation over there. I think humanitarian efforts are the most important in those cases. My best friend would have been so fascinated by all of this."],"2704":["Not everyone is aware of that news. But it's always a relief to hear about citizens being safely returned home. Imagine the journey they must have gone through."],"2705":["Yes, I heard about that. It's a complicated situation over there. Hopefully, the situation will improve soon."],"2706":["Yes, that iPhone is by far the most powerful device I've ever owned. And no, I haven't heard about the US citizen being released to a Syrian town. That's interesting news."],"2707":["I haven't heard about that, but it sounds like a great story. Wouldn't you like to visit Syria someday to see the town yourself?"],"2708":["I'm from Japan. Would you like to visit there someday?"],"2709":["I'm actually from Japan, but my wife would say Cleveland is one of the most passionate cities about baseball that she has ever seen."],"2710":["I'm from Venezuela.  The Red Sox are by far the most successful team in baseball this season."],"2711":["I'm from Brazil. If you ever visit, I can show you around."],"2712":["I'm from Venezuela, a country known for producing talented baseball players. It's a shame we never got a chance to see a Venezuelan team in the World Series."],"2713":["That's interesting. I would never have thought about that! But it just goes to show you never really know what goes on behind closed doors, especially when it comes to high-profile figures like presidents."],"2714":["Really? That is one of the weirdest rituals I have ever heard of. I'm not sure if that would actually make anyone run faster, but hey, whatever works, I guess."],"2715":["That is definitely an interesting tidbit! I think it's safe to say that is by far the weirdest pre-game ritual I have ever heard of."],"2716":["That is one of the funniest rituals I've ever heard of! I doubt that would give anyone an advantage but hey, whatever works!"],"2717":["That's definitely a weird ritual! I think it would be really cool to learn about the unusual habits and routines of different presidents throughout history."],"2718":["True, not everyone would handle a breakup like that."],"2719":["I heard that was the final straw for their relationship. Neither party seemed happy in the end."],"2720":["Neither of them seemed happy in the end, the relationship was doomed from the start."],"2721":["Would you consider giving another style of music a chance? Maybe some classical or jazz could help broaden your musical horizons."],"2722":["I don't think Russell Brand would ever do something like that, he seems more respectful than that."],"2723":["Iron man built the first Iron Man suit in a cave while in captivity, that was the best moment in the movie."],"2724":["He was known as the most resilient captive in history."],"2725":["He would have done anything to escape, even built a suit of armor."],"2726":["If he hadn't built the iron man suit, he wouldn't have been able to escape."],"2727":["Tony Stark's transformation into Iron Man was the best comeback story of all time."],"2728":["I didn't know that, but it would be interesting to see how that data is used for analysis after the game."],"2729":["Yes, I do! That's actually a fascinating use of technology in sports."],"2730":["Yes, I do. It's one of the most advanced technologies in sports today."],"2731":["Oh wow, I didn't know that! I would have thought it was just based on what the players could see on the field."],"2732":["That's fascinating! I had no idea they utilized such advanced technology in football. It's undoubtedly the best way to analyze player performance."],"2733":["Actually, yes. The University of Iowa has one of the best home records in the league."],"2734":["The visiting locker room at U of Iowa is the best I've ever seen. It's definitely a unique experience! And no, they've never had a winning streak at home because of it."],"2735":["Don't you think that would be a bit insulting to the visiting team?"],"2736":["Would you like to make a pink locker room for the opposing team at our school's games? It would be a fun way to throw them off their game!"],"2737":["Actually, it hasn't made much of a difference. They are still struggling to win consistently, especially against tough opponents."],"2738":["I love watching The Simpsons! It's one of the funniest animated shows on TV."],"2739":["Yes, I love watching The Simpsons. It is one of the longest-running animated shows on television. None can compare to its humor and clever writing. Would you like me to recommend an episode for you to watch?"],"2740":["I used to watch The Simpsons. I would always laugh at their jokes."],"2741":["I would have watched The Simpsons when I was younger, but I don't watch it anymore."],"2742":["Yes, I love watching The Simpsons! It is one of the funniest animated shows on TV."],"2743":["I believe the reason for that law was a deeply ingrained societal norm at the time. None of the other women senators objected to it until 1993. The fact that it took so long shows how slow progress can be sometimes."],"2744":["I did not know that! I always thought it would be more recent presidents who were the wealthiest. Interesting! Speaking of the president, did you know that Abraham Lincoln is often considered the best president in American history?"],"2745":["I know, it's crazy to think about how outdated some of these rules and laws are. I agree, the president should have definitely changed that dress code sooner. It's interesting to learn about the top three wealthiest presidents in American history."],"2746":["Yes, it is quite surprising that women senators were not allowed to wear pants for so long. It's incredible to think about the progress we have made in equality. Did you know that the best president in history, according to many historians, was Abraham Lincoln? His leadership during the Civil War was unparalleled."],"2747":["That's interesting, I would have never guessed that those three presidents were the wealthiest. I wonder how they amassed such wealth. It's fascinating to think about the history behind it all."],"2748":["Did you know that Cadillac is one of the oldest car manufacturers in the United States?"],"2749":["Do you know which car brand has the most luxurious interiors? It would be one of the top luxury car brands out there."],"2750":["Did you know that Cadillac is one of the oldest automotive brands in the world?"],"2751":["He had the faintest idea that his name would become synonymous with luxury cars."],"2752":["That's interesting! I think that Cadillac has the most luxurious cars in the market."],"2753":["Undoubtedly, it took Mike and Sully the best part of the day to make it from the mailroom to the Scare Team."],"2754":["I think it took them the best two days to make it from the mailroom to the Scare Team."],"2755":["I would say it probably took them quite some time, considering all the obstacles they had to overcome."],"2756":["I would say it would have taken them quite a while, considering how different their skill sets were. Would you mind not underestimating their determination to succeed?"],"2757":["Undoubtedly, it would have taken them the shortest amount of time compared to anyone in the history of Monsters University."],"2758":["I can't believe the reviews were so negative, I really enjoyed it."],"2759":["I wouldn't say it's the best, but it was definitely enjoyable."],"2760":["By far, the sequel was the best in the series."],"2761":["I strongly believe it would have been even better with a different director."],"2762":["I would argue this version is the best adaptation yet."],"2763":["Yes, she did. She won the Oscar for Best Actress for that role. It was definitely one of her finest performances."],"2764":["Actually, she wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for that role."],"2765":["Yes, she did! She gave one of the best performances in her career in that movie."],"2766":["Yes, she did! She won the Oscar for Best Actress that year. She was by far the best choice for that role. Would you like to watch it again sometime?"],"2767":["Yes, she did! She won the Oscar for Best Actress."],"2768":["Not only can dogs like music, but they can also have preferences for different genres. They are truly amazing animals."],"2769":["Dogs can actually have a good sense of hearing and can enjoy different types of music. They can even have a favorite genre!"],"2770":["None of my dogs like music, but they do respond to hand signals."],"2771":["Yes, some dogs have been known to enjoy music and even have preferences for certain genres. Classical music by far seems to be the most soothing for them."],"2772":["Yes, some dogs have been known to enjoy music. In fact, I read about a study that found classical music can have a calming effect on dogs in animal shelters. It's definitely one of the best ways to keep them relaxed."],"2773":["I bet they have to search high and low for floppy disks now, especially considering they are getting more and more outdated."],"2774":["I'm not sure, but I heard they are still being used in some government offices. It's surprising considering how outdated they are."],"2775":["Maybe they are hoarding them in a secure bunker somewhere, just in case. There's probably a secret floppy disk black market out there."],"2776":["Maybe they have a top-secret supplier that specializes in vintage technology. Or maybe they just have a stockpile of floppy disks hidden in a secure vault somewhere."],"2777":["They probably have a secret stash hidden away somewhere in case of emergencies. But it does make you wonder who still manufactures floppy disks in this digital age."],"2778":["I know, it's definitely a natural feeling to want to protect them from everything.  I think the best experience I've had is watching my kids grow and learn to navigate the world on their own."],"2779":["I don't think there's any way to completely protect them from everything. It's all about finding a balance between keeping them safe and letting them learn from their experiences."],"2780":["Absolutely, I would undoubtedly say that protecting our children from harm is a top priority for all parents. But we must also allow them to learn and grow through experiences, even if it means taking risks."],"2781":["But at the end of the day, we have to let them experience life and learn from their own experiences. It's important for their development."],"2782":["My best friend always says that it's important to find a balance between protecting them and letting them experience life. It's tough sometimes, but I think he's right. Neither sheltering them too much nor exposing them to too many dangers is good for their development."],"2783":["Yeah, Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I think the hyphen is there to differentiate him from other superheroes with similar names. Would you mind looking it up to confirm?"],"2784":["It's actually because Spider-Man is one of the oldest and most iconic superheroes in comic book history."],"2785":["I'm not sure, but I would guess it's just for style."],"2786":["Would you believe it if I told you it's because of a mistake in the first comic book? The hyphen was accidentally left in and then it stuck!"],"2787":["Yes, because it was originally a comic book character created by Stan Lee. My best friend would like to invite you to watch the latest Spiderman movie with us."],"2788":["Yes, it was truly an impressive feat. Their dedication to their music was unparalleled."],"2789":["They definitely had a strong work ethic. They were one of the hardest-working bands in the industry at that time."],"2790":["It would have been exhausting to do that many concerts in just one year. I can't imagine how demanding their schedule must have been."],"2791":["They definitely worked hard to build their fan base. And not only did they tour extensively, but they also released two more successful albums in the following years."],"2792":["Yeah, they definitely had the busiest schedule. I can't imagine how exhausting that must have been for them. Would you mind traveling that much for work?"],"2793":["Undoubtedly, the sun is the best source of energy for us to utilize. It's incredible to think about just how powerful and abundant the sun's energy truly is."],"2794":["It would be incredible if we could fully utilize all of the sun's energy to power our planet. The sun is truly one of the most powerful sources of energy in our solar system."],"2795":["I know, it's incredible! If we could harness more of that energy, we could make a huge impact on our planet. I would love to see more renewable energy sources like solar power become the norm."],"2796":["It's truly remarkable! The sun is indeed the ultimate source of energy in our solar system. The sheer magnitude of its power is mind-blowing. If only we could find a way to efficiently harness and utilize more of that energy, we could potentially solve many of our energy-related issues here on Earth."],"2797":["Yes, it's truly mind-blowing to think about the sheer magnitude of the sun's power. The faintest idea of how we could fully utilize that energy is an exciting prospect for the future. Wouldn't it be incredible if we could unlock the secrets of solar energy on a global scale?"],"2798":["Personally, I don't think beanies really count as hats since they don't have a brim to protect against the sun. It would be more accurate to call them headwear."],"2799":["Yes, beanies are technically hats, but they are more casual and laid-back compared to other styles. Would you like a beanie for the upcoming winter season?"],"2800":["True! Beanies are hats, just of a different style. They may not be as stylish as cowboy hats, but they definitely serve their purpose in keeping you warm."],"2801":["Beanies are indeed hats, and they are my warmest option for cold weather. In fact, my best friend wears the coziest beanie I've ever seen."],"2802":["Beanies are by far the most comfortable and versatile type of hat, in my opinion. They can be worn in almost any weather and with any outfit."],"2803":["That would have been the best hiding spot!"],"2804":["One of the funniest comments I've ever heard, I would never have thought of that!"],"2805":["I would undoubtedly be devastated if it were to disappear."],"2806":["I would be one of the messiest rooms ever!"],"2807":["Not the slightest chance it would end up in a gym bag."],"2808":["That sounds terrible. Was she considered the most resilient person in her community?"],"2809":["That sounds incredibly tough. I can't imagine going through something like that."],"2810":["Not only did she suffer from abuse, but she also had to endure extreme poverty."],"2811":["That sounds terrible. Is she considered the best actress in Hollywood history?"],"2812":["That sounds horrible. I can't imagine going through the faintest amount of what she endured."],"2813":["Yes, I have seen it and it's the best animated movie I've ever watched."],"2814":["Yes, I have seen it. It was my best friend's favorite movie. If you haven't watched it yet, I would definitely recommend it."],"2815":["Yes, I have seen it. It's the best animated movie of the year."],"2816":["Yes, I have. It's the best movie I've ever seen. Have you watched it yet?"],"2817":["Yes, I have. It's actually the best animated movie I've ever watched."],"2818":["Wow, that's a long time! It must be one of the longest-running animated series then."],"2819":["Wow, that's a long time. I didn't realize Pokemon had been around for so long!"],"2820":["Wow, 16 years is a long time for a TV show to run. My best friend's little brother is a huge fan of Pokemon and has seen every episode multiple times."],"2821":["that's impressive! Pokemon must be one of the longest-running animated series ever."],"2822":["Wow, that's a long time for a cartoon series! I can't believe they are still making new episodes after all these years."],"2823":["I actually think Tobey Maguire is the best Spiderman actor of all."],"2824":["I don't like Tobey Maguire in the slightest."],"2825":["No, I didn't like him in that role either. I prefer other actors for those types of movies."],"2826":["Actually, I would prefer not to comment on that."],"2827":["Neither do I like him nor do I like Leonardo di Caprio. My favorite actor is actually Tom Hanks."],"2828":["I would have never thought that something like that would be possible. It's mind-blowing to think about how advanced technology has become."],"2829":["Yeah, that's a huge difference! It would be not only interesting but also mind-blowing to imagine the amount of processing power needed to create something like that."],"2830":["Wow, that's mind-blowing! I can't even imagine the processing power needed for a 55,000 core computer. It must have taken forever to render each frame of the movie."],"2831":["That's insane! Disney always goes all out with their animations, but using a 55,000 core computer is by far the most intense I've ever heard of for rendering. My mind is blown just thinking about it."],"2832":["That's insane! I can't believe the amount of computing power that goes into these animated films. I'd love to visit one of the studios and see how they make it all happen."],"2833":["I was thinking of \"Catch Me If You Can.\" It's a really captivating story about a young con artist on the run. The way he outsmarts everyone is just incredible. Have you seen it?"],"2834":["One of the funniest adventure movies I have ever seen is \"Catch Me If You Can\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It's about a con artist who would pretend to be different people and commit crimes, but it's not your typical action movie."],"2835":["I was thinking of \"Catch Me If You Can\" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It's based on a true story about a young con artist. Not all of it is action-packed but it has a good mix of humor and drama."],"2836":["I was thinking of \"Catch Me If You Can.\" It's one of the most interesting films I've ever watched."],"2837":["I was thinking of \"Catch Me If You Can.\" It's a fantastic film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Have you seen it?"],"2838":["Surely MadDog 2020 is the most top secret candidate of all time."],"2839":["I don't think MadDog is the best choice for president."],"2840":["Would they definitely take over if MadDog won?"],"2841":["Could there possibly be the slightest chance that you're being sarcastic?"],"2842":["I strongly doubt that MadDog would win the election in 2020."],"2843":["Yes, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of my favorite movie series of all time. Not only did it have incredible visuals and storytelling, but also an outstanding cast."],"2844":["Yes, undoubtedly, the Lord of the Rings trilogy was one of the most epic movie series of all time."],"2845":["Yeah, it's hard to believe that one of the most successful franchises actually faced the biggest losses. But the slightest hint of disappointment didn't stop fans from loving it."],"2846":["I know, right? It's one of the most beloved fantasy series of all time."],"2847":["Yeah, it's definitely one of my favorites. In fact, my best friend and I would like to invite you to watch it with us this weekend."],"2848":["It's just unbelievable how some people can be so intolerant and discriminatory. Those instances definitely highlight the importance of addressing systemic racism in our society."],"2849":["It's truly disheartening to hear about situations like that. I would hope that as a society we can move towards a more understanding and inclusive environment."],"2850":["It's really sad how racial profiling still happens in this day and age. Would you like to take part in a peaceful protest against discrimination and raise awareness in our community?"],"2851":["It's truly disheartening to see how some individuals would go to such lengths to discriminate against others. I can't imagine the fear and frustration those affected must have felt in those situations."],"2852":["It's truly disturbing how prevalent these incidents are becoming. This is by far one of the saddest aspects of our society today."]}}
