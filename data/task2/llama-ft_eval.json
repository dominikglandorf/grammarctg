I am not sure I want that though."],"1096":["Haha, that would be crazy. I am not sure if it would be a good TV show though."],"1097":["Haha, that would be crazy. I wonder if the runner up would ever actually be the vice president, or if it would be the runner up in the house of representatives?"],"1098":["I think it's a great movie for kids.  I would watch it again."],"1099":["I think he would like that part too"],"1100":["I think that's what I would like my grandson to learn.

I'm not sure how I would feel if I were Pluto."],"1104":["I'm not sure I'd like to be in a situation where I have to rely on an iPhone to protect me from a nuclear attack - I'd rather have a few nukes to protect me!"],"1105":["I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing - I mean, I know I can't afford an iPhone, but I'm not sure I want to be able to blow up the world either!"],"1106":["I'm not sure I want to know that - I mean, if I were the US, I'd want to be able to destroy the entire world in a few seconds, not just the US nuclear deterrent!"],"1107":["I agree. I think that the best way to deal with people like that is to make them irrelevant. They are not the most important people in the world. They are just a bunch of rich people who want to get richer."],"1108":["I'm not sure that's the best way to handle it. It's not like they're plotting to overthrow the government. They're just trying to make money. They can't be stopped, but they can be punished."],"1109":["I agree. I'm not sure if it would be possible in the US, but it's possible in other countries. In the 1980s, the US government actually funded the IRA. That's a good example of how the government can be treasonous."],"1110":["I haven't listened to that one. I'm not sure I'd like it. I like my music."],"1111":["I would listen to that if I could. I love classic dramas."],"1112":["I would like to listen to that.

I would watch the games with my best friend."],"1116":["I would like to see a streaming service that has a lot of documentaries.  I love documentaries."],"1117":["I think they would need to have a lot of money to get the content.

They are the best in the content area."],"1119":["I think it was the best show on TV at the time.  Did you know that the best way to get a job in Hollywood is to be related to someone in the industry?"],"1120":["I would like to see it.  It was the highest rated show on the network at the time."],"1121":["I think it was because it was the first show to be broadcast in high definition.  I would have liked to have seen it."],"1122":["I agree, I have never been nominated for anything, but I have been nominated for a few things, but not for anything I am proud of, so I guess I am not that bad."],"1123":["I agree, I can't believe that the highest grossing film of all time is still the 1939 film \"Gone with the Wind\""],"1124":["I agree, I think that is the best way to get a good film made, but I guess it's not the most glamorous thing in the world."],"1125":["Yes, he is.

I would have liked to have been the voice of Flounder in The Little Mermaid, I think I could have done that haha."],"1130":["Yeah I don't get it either, but I guess it's a way to get them to do the movie. I would have liked to have been the voice of the mouse in the Rescuers Down Under, he was the best!"],"1131":["I think it's a positive. The best way to describe a wolf is a fierce and powerful predator."],"1132":["I think it's a positive. The movie is about a woman who is a wolf in sheep's clothing, so I would assume that being a wolf is good."],"1133":["I think it's a positive. The movie is about a woman who is a wolf in sheep's clothing, so I would assume that it's a positive."],"1134":["I love it. It is the most used menu in the world."],"1135":["I didn't know that.

The White House is a pretty big building, I'm not sure it's the only one in the world."],"1147":["I did, I'm not sure why they built it, but it's interesting. I wonder if the White House is the biggest house in the world, I know the largest house in the world is the palace of Versailles."],"1148":["I did, I'm not sure I'd like to live in it, but it's nice to know that the White House has a twin. I'm not sure I'd like to live in the smallest house in the world, either."],"1149":["I can't imagine how they are going to do that."],"1150":["I'm not sure if that would be a good thing."],"1151":["That's a good idea.

I would have thought they would have been."],"1161":["I'm not sure if they are registered, but I know they are out there. I'm not sure if they are actually super heroes, though."],"1162":["I didn't know that either. I wonder if they are registered in other countries too. If I were a superhero, I would have registered."],"1163":["I'm not sure if they are, but I know that there are a lot of them. I would like to be one, but I don't think I would like the costume."],"1164":["I wonder if he ever played in the World Cup.  I know that the best soccer player in the world is a woman.  She is the only one to ever win the FIFA Golden Ball award."],"1165":["I am not sure.  I would have liked to have seen him play.  I can't imagine him being a star."],"1166":["I am not sure.

If I lived in Harlem, I would have gone."],"1196":["That's amazing!  I would like to attend one of those.  I'm not sure if I could get in though."],"1197":["Yeah that would be bad.

I can't imagine it being invented by one person."],"1210":["No, I didn't know that. I wonder if he would have ever thought it would be played in the Olympics?"],"1211":["I didn't know that either.
