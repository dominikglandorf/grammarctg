It's my best friend's favorite movie and she always talks about it."],"42":["I would have liked it if Vector had just kept his word and not taken the girls."],"43":["A: I wouldn't have liked it if he had taken the money, not at all!"],"44":["A: But I don't think it's the best idea to give Vector the shrink ray, can you do something else? I would like it if Gru could find another way to get the girls back."],"45":["A: To be honest, I think my favorite show was actually the most popular one, \"The Simpsons\". I loved watching it every week, it was the best way to relax after a long day."],"46":["A: Actually, I think my favorite show was \"Tales from the Darkside\", it was the most frightening one I've ever seen, and I watched it every week, in fact, I was addicted to it!"],"47":["A: Actually, I'm not a big fan of most TV shows, but I have to say that I'm absolutely fascinated by documentaries. I mean, they're the most informative and educational programs out there, and I find them incredibly engaging. I wish I had more time to watch them, but unfortunately, I'm always busy with work and other commitments."],"48":["I would have loved to know more about Samuel L Jackson's golf clause if I had been a golf enthusiast back then."],"49":["I'm not a big fan of golf, to be honest. I'd rather watch a baseball game, like a Yankees game, and cheer for my favorite team."],"50":["I'm not a big fan of golf, to be honest. I'd rather spend my time outdoors, like hiking or biking. But I do appreciate the beauty of a well-maintained golf course."],"51":["I would have to agree, we always have interesting discussions about superheroes."],"52":["I don't think I would have liked Loki if he wasn't so mean."],"53":["A: If I had been in the Avengers, I would have chosen Captain America as my superhero."],"54":["I would have loved to have seen it when I was younger, but I was too busy with school back then."],"55":["I'm not really into sci-fi movies, but I would like to watch it, like, if I had the time."],"56":["I'm not really a fan of sci-fi movies, but I would love to watch this one because it's supposed to be the best in the series."],"57":["I don't think it's weird, it's a good movie."],"58":["A: But it's actually the highest-grossing film of all time, in terms of worldwide box office revenue."],"59":["I would love to watch it, it's the best movie of the year, to my liking."],"60":["A: Jeff Bridges is one of the most iconic actors in Hollywood, isn't he?"],"61":["A: He's my best actor!"],"62":["A: But is he the best actor in this movie?"],"63":["A: I used to play chess with my grandfather every Sunday afternoon when I was a child."],"64":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is actually a chess champion and he would play for hours every day when he was younger."],"65":["I don't think it's the most popular game in the world, but it's definitely one of the oldest. Would you believe it's been around for over 500 years?"],"66":["A: If I had been there, I would have joined them, but I'm not sure I would have been willing to stay for days."],"67":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how attitudes have changed over the years. I wouldn't have expected the Vatican to endorse it back in '99, not to mention the fact that it was banned in the first place."],"68":["A: If I had been there, I would have joined them, but I don't think I would have been very good at protesting."],"69":["I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio was the best."],"70":["My best friend is Leonardo DiCaprio, I would like him to act in more movies like this."],"71":["A: That's a tough one, but I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was the most impressive to watch. Would you like to know why I think so?"],"72":["A: That's true, and it's impressive that Demetri Martin has been able to achieve so much success in comedy, considering he could have had a lucrative career in law."],"73":["A: But I don't think he's the only one who made a good decision. I mean, Demetri Martin can't be the only one who's been successful after leaving Harvard. Can he?"],"74":["I think it's amazing that Demetri Martin and Ryan Stiles followed their passions, even if it meant giving up a prestigious education. I would love to know more about their stories and how they managed to achieve their goals."],"75":["I don't think it's a good idea to tell you the twist, because it's a big surprise and it can ruin the movie for you."],"76":["A: I'm not sure if I should reveal the twist, but it's the most surprising one I've ever seen in a movie, and it's going to blow your mind!"],"77":["I think the twist is the most surprising part of the movie, to be honest. Would you like me to reveal it?"],"78":["A: But I don't think Frank Sinatra's music is as widely popular among young people as Bob Marley's is, not even close."],"79":["A: If I had been a music critic, I would have written a review of his album \"In the Wee Small Hours\" when it was released."],"80":["A: I think my best friend loves Frank Sinatra's music, and I would like to listen to his songs like \"My Way\" and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" again."],"81":["A: That's not true, I haven't seen the White House in Ireland, and I'm sure it's not just a replica, it's a real house!"],"82":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't have thought that, but I've always been fascinated by the history of the White House. I didn't know that the presidents didn't just live there, I thought they would have a normal house like everyone else."],"83":["I don't think so! To be honest, I've never seen the White House in France or Ireland, and I'm sure it's not the same as the one in Washington. I would love to visit them, though - it would be amazing to see the most beautiful and historic buildings up close!"],"84":["I think it's fascinating to see how the wealthiest presidents in U.S. history have been able to maintain their wealth, despite being in a position where they could have easily become even richer."],"85":["I think it's interesting to note that the wealthiest presidents in U.S. history have been quite different in terms of their personalities and leadership styles. For instance, JFK was known for his charisma and charm, while Washington was renowned for his integrity and honesty."],"86":["I think it's interesting that you mention the wealthiest presidents. My best friend is actually a huge history buff and loves learning about these kinds of facts. Not only is it fascinating to see how their wealth was accumulated, but it's also a reminder that even the most powerful people can't escape the effects of time and circumstance. I would love to learn more about their financial decisions and how they managed their wealth."],"87":["A: Would you like to know what kind of crimes the rabbit police officer solves?"],"88":["A: This movie is the most entertaining comedy I've seen all year, and I can't stop laughing!"],"89":["I would like to know more about this comedy adventure. Is it the funniest movie you have ever seen?"],"90":["I think it's my best friend's favorite superhero, and I agree that it fits his character."],"91":["I think it was the most reckless decision Tony Stark has ever made, to reveal his true identity as Iron Man. If I were in his shoes, I would have found a way to keep his dual life separate, to avoid putting his loved ones in danger."],"92":["I don't think it was a good idea for Tony Stark to reveal his identity as Iron Man. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have done it."],"93":["I don't think Reebok was desperate, they were smart! They knew Iverson was a big star and would bring them a lot of attention."],"94":["A: Yeah, Reebok must have been desperate, but I would like to know what made them agree to that deal!"],"95":["A: Yeah, Reebok must have been desperate! I wouldn't have expected them to offer such a generous deal."],"96":["I would love to know which episode of The Simpsons that is! Can you tell me more about it?"],"97":["A: That's really surprising! I don't think there's a single episode of The Simpsons without Homer in it, is there?"],"98":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I've always thought that the episode where Lisa doesn't appear is really weird. I mean, it's not like it's a normal thing for a main character to be missing from an episode."],"99":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would always get in trouble at school for trying to sell my old toys to my friends for way too much money."],"100":["I would love to learn more about this pump and dump thing, like what's the most successful one they've done so far?"],"101":["I would have thought that Jordan's friends would have been more careful, wouldn't you?"],"102":["A: That's my best friend's favorite candy!"],"103":["A: That's amazing! I can't believe they used the same gavel for so long. It must have been very special to them."],"104":["I'm not very busy, but I would usually be busy on weekdays."],"105":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is a huge fan of Starship Troopers, he's read it like five times!"],"106":["A: That's really interesting! I've never read a biography about President Andrew Johnson before. I'm more interested in reading about the history of a specific area, like the history of the United States in the 19th century, in which I'm not very good at."],"107":["That's really interesting! I would have thought that someone who was the President of the United States would have had a good education. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have been able to cope without a good education."],"108":["I completely agree, I would always watch the first Toy Story movie with my siblings when we were kids, and it's still a classic."],"109":["I completely agree with you, the animation in the first movie is quite dated. I wish they would release a remastered version with improved graphics, like they did with the Lion King, so we could enjoy it in high definition."],"110":["I completely disagree, I think the animation in the first movie is still the best, not even the slightest bit creepy! Would it be amazing if they released a remastered version with the most advanced animation technology, making it look even more stunning than the second one?"],"111":["I used to watch that movie every week when I was a kid."],"112":["I completely agree with you, it's actually my best friend's favorite movie, and I've never seen anyone not enjoying it!"],"113":["I don't think it's the best movie, but I would like to watch it again."],"114":["I don't think it's possible for Facebook to be valued at 104 billion dollars in 2005, can you confirm that?"],"115":["That's really interesting! I didn't know that. My best friend is a huge fan of Facebook and he's been using it since it was first launched. He's been saying that it's the best social media platform for years."],"116":["I would have loved to know more about the early days of Facebook, like what Mark Zuckerberg's daily routine was like back then."],"117":["A: That's not true, actually. Jellyfish don't evaporate in the sun, they're incredibly resilient and can survive in a wide range of temperatures and environments."],"118":["A: That's amazing! But, actually, the most fascinating creature is the axolotl. It's a type of salamander that never undergoes metamorphosis, so it keeps its gills and lives underwater its whole life."],"119":["A: I don't think it's possible to evaporate in the sun, can you imagine if jellyfish could do that? If I were a jellyfish, I would be worried about drying out!"],"120":["A: That's great! My best friend is also doing well."],"121":["A: I'm not so good, I've been feeling really tired lately."],"122":["A: I'm not doing well, I'm feeling a bit tired. Would you like to go for a walk with me?"],"123":["A: It's the funniest animation I've ever seen, and it's perfect for watching with the whole family in one sitting."],"124":["A: But is it the most funny animation you've ever seen?"],"125":["A: But it's not the best movie for young children, I don't think."],"126":["A: I would like to see it too, but I don't like action movies like that."],"127":["I wouldn't have thought you wouldn't like it, it's a really good film."],"128":["A: Oh, really? I've always been fascinated by the most intense and dramatic war movies, like Dunkirk. I would love to see it on the biggest screen possible."],"129":["A: But isn't it weird that some people gave it a 1 out of 10?"],"130":["A: I think Loki is my best friend in the Marvel movies, I would have been really upset if he wasn't in the new Avengers movie."],"131":["A: I think Loki is my best friend in the Marvel universe, I would love to watch his movies like crazy!"],"132":["I think if I were in Kanye's shoes, I would have done the same thing. If I had to make a name for myself, I would have done something dramatic too."],"133":["I don't think Trump's antics would have been so popular if he wasn't already used to getting away with it. He's always been someone who does what he wants and doesn't care about the consequences."],"134":["I think it's ridiculous that some people still defend Kanye's behavior, saying it's just his personality. In reality, it's not acceptable to be rude and inconsiderate, especially when it's done on a global stage."],"135":["A: That's fascinating, I've heard that mantis shrimp have the most advanced color vision of any animal, with the ability to see up to 12 different colors, which is incredible!"],"136":["I think it's really fascinating that dogs don't see as many colors as humans, and I would love to learn more about their visual abilities."],"137":["I'm not sure I agree with you, humans don't see as many colors as mantis shrimp, but I would like to know more about their vision."],"138":["I would have watched the Oscars if I had been a famous director, but I wouldn't have won because I'm not that good at making movies."],"139":["A: Actually, I don't really watch the Academy Awards either, but I do keep up with the most popular movies and TV shows, and I think it's crazy that the Star Wars franchise is not only the most successful one, but also the one that has made the most money in the world."],"140":["I would have loved to have been there when Lucas was accepting his award, but if I had been at the ceremony, I wouldn't have been surprised if he would have given an emotional speech."],"141":["I apologize, but I cannot write a response that discusses suicide. Is there something else I can help you with?"],"142":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's like, the most confusing part of the movie!"],"143":["I'm still trying to wrap my head around the most disturbing plot twist in the book - the way the author handled the character's death is just heart-wrenching. I would have liked it if the author had given more context to make it less shocking."],"144":["I would have thought that if I were in Hiccup's shoes, I would have been really upset about losing a part of my body, but it seems like he's coping well with the prosthetic leg."],"145":["I don't think the 98% score is fair. The movie is not perfect, it has some flaws."],"146":["I wouldn't have expected the ending to be so heartwarming, to be honest. If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have thought that Stoick would be capable of such a selfless act."],"147":["A: But I don't think he did, because he said he only found old cards from the 80s and 90s. Can't imagine finding something that valuable just by chance!"],"148":["A: That's amazing! I've heard of people finding incredible things in their attics, but that's the most astonishing thing I've ever heard!"],"149":["A: That's amazing! I would love to find a treasure like that! Do you think it's the most incredible story you've ever heard?"],"150":["I don't think so. They don't allow dogs at work."],"151":["I don't think they do. I've never heard of a company that allows dogs at work, and Google is definitely not an exception."],"152":["I'm shocked! I would have expected them to be more open-minded, considering their motto is \"Don't be evil\"."],"153":["I don't think it's that bad."],"154":["I wouldn't mind if they didn't make another Superman movie."],"155":["I would have thought that the movie would have been a huge success if it had a better cast."],"156":["I think the Fender Stratocaster has reached its ultimate potential in rock music, as it's often considered the most iconic and versatile instrument in the genre."],"157":["A: That's really sad! I would like to know more about the African American country music artists. Do you think they would have been more successful if they had more support from the industry?"],"158":["I'm not sure if the Fender Stratocaster has ever reached its true potential in country music, but it's definitely been used to create some amazing rock songs."],"159":["I would have loved it if I had seen it with you."],"160":["I'm a big fan of his movies too. In fact, I would watch his films over and over again, they're that good!"],"161":["I completely disagree with you, it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen in my life."],"162":["I don't think Kim Jong-un is a genius, he can't even do what he wants with his country!"],"163":["A: That's amazing! My best friend's brother is a genius too, he's a doctor and has written many books. He's the smartest person I know!"],"164":["I'm not sure I'd want to be a genius like Kim Jong-un, though - I think I'd rather have a more balanced life! Would you like to learn more about his physics degree, or is there something else you're more interested in?"],"165":["I would like to vote for a change."],"166":["A: But isn't it strange that it took so long for women to get the right to vote in the UK, in 1928?"],"167":["That's a really interesting fact about the UK. It's unbelievable that some men didn't have the right to vote until 1918, isn't it? I would not like to live in a society where my voice is not heard."],"168":["I think it's the most romantic film to watch with a loved one, especially on a Friday evening."],"169":["A: Yes, it's my best friend's favorite movie, and she would always watch it every Friday night."],"170":["I'm not sure it's the most recent movie, but it's definitely one of the most popular ones to watch with a partner. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about it not being the latest release, because it's still a great choice."],"171":["I would have recommended it if I had seen it earlier, but I only watched it last week."],"172":["I wouldn't recommend it, to be honest. My best friend didn't enjoy it at all, and I think it's not as good as some of his other movies."],"173":["I wouldn't recommend it, to be honest. If I had seen it, I wouldn't have been blown away by the acting, not even by his outstanding performance."],"174":["A: That's my best friend Jordan, he's the most clever one I know!"],"175":["A: That's my best friend, Jordan! He's really good at making money, I wish I could be like him!"],"176":["A: But that's not true, Jordan didn't find two friends and they didn't found a company. He would often talk about his business ideas, but he never actually did anything with them."],"177":["A: But wasn't it actually ancient Greece, not Athens?"],"178":["A: Yeah, and I wouldn't have expected that to happen, not even in my wildest dreams!"],"179":["A: But it's not the best movie, I don't think. I can't say I love it like some people do."],"180":["A: That's incredible! Did you know that the world's largest waterfall, Victoria Falls, is located in Africa?"],"181":["A: That's incredible! I would love to learn more about Hedy Lamarr's contributions to the invention of the cell phone."],"182":["That's really interesting! Would you know that the United Nations has been working on providing clean water to people in need for years?"],"183":["A: That's really cool! I think it's my best friend's favorite fact about phones too!"],"184":["A: That's really cool! I would like to know more about those underwater phone lines. Do you think it would be interesting to visit one of them?"],"185":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by the fact that the longest undersea telephone cable, the TAT-14, spans over 10,000 kilometers, connecting North America to Europe. And it's incredible to think that it's not just used for phone calls, but also for internet and even financial transactions."],"186":["I think I would have loved to work for NASA back then, if I had been given the chance. It would have been an incredible experience, learning about the challenges they faced and the innovative solutions they came up with."],"187":["I wouldn't, I don't think I could do that job, it's not something I'm used to."],"188":["I think it would be an incredible experience to work for NASA, but I'm not sure if I would be good enough to handle the pressure. If I had to choose, I would probably be willing to take on the challenge, but I'm not sure if I would be the best person for the job."],"189":["A: That's amazing, I've heard the Hawkeyes' Children's Hospital visits are the most heartwarming events in college football, to bring joy to those kids is truly the most rewarding experience."],"190":["A: Ah, I'm glad you appreciate the charity work, but I'm not a fan of the Saints either, actually I think they're the worst team in the NFL, and their cheerleaders' requirement is just ridiculous!"],"191":["I'm not a big fan of the Saints, to be honest. I think it's ridiculous that they make their cheerleaders leave the field when the players come out. Would I be upset if I were a Saints fan, I'd be really angry about that rule!"],"192":["A: Yeah, Amazon's impact is truly massive, and its ability to adapt to new technologies in a very short time is incredible, especially with its vast network of warehouses and delivery systems all over the world, which is really impressive in scale."],"193":["A: But I don't think it can hurt their business too much, because Amazon is the biggest in the world, and it's not going to stop being popular soon."],"194":["I don't think the price matching at Best Buy and Target has hurt Amazon's business at all. In fact, Amazon is still the most successful online retailer in the world."],"195":["I haven't read any of Shakespeare's plays, but I've seen some movie adaptations."],"196":["I wouldn't have thought that, but I don't really like Shakespeare."],"197":["I haven't really been into Shakespeare, but my best friend is a huge fan and has read all of his plays. She says they're really good, but I wouldn't know because I've never had the time to read them."],"198":["I don't think it's possible for a computer to run on water, is it?"],"199":["I would have loved to see how people would react if they had to code their own programs today. Can you imagine the frustration?"],"200":["I'd love to see that old computer in action, it's probably the most fascinating thing I've ever heard of!"],"201":["That's a great question! I'm actually the biggest Pok\u00e9mon fan, I've been playing the games since I was a kid and I still play them to this day, to be honest, I've spent the most hours playing Pok\u00e9mon of anyone I know, it's just so addictive!"],"202":["A: Ah, no, I'm not a huge fan of Pok\u00e9mon, but I do enjoy the \"Weekend Updates\" segment, it's the most popular one, and I think it's because it's the most relatable, you know?"],"203":["A: No, I'm not a big fan of Pok\u00e9mon, but I can understand why people like it. I'm more of a fan of the \"Weekend Updates\" because they're really funny and I can watch them over and over again. Would you like to watch some of the older episodes together?"],"204":["I don't think Iowa is a very good football team. They haven't been very successful in recent years."],"205":["A: Ah, no, Iowa's not exactly the best football team, but they've had some great moments, especially under Coach Fry."],"206":["A: No, Iowa is not the best football team. They are not even in the top three teams in the Big Ten. But, I would like to watch them play at Kinnick Stadium, it's the best stadium in the country."],"207":["I don't think it's a very interesting book, to be honest. Can you tell me more about it?"],"208":["A: Yeah, it's a classic, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite. I didn't used to read much when I was younger, but I've been making an effort to read more often lately."],"209":["A: Yeah, it's actually really interesting, but it's a bit long, it's one of the longest science fiction novels ever written, so it's not for everyone, but if you like that kind of thing, you might enjoy it."],"210":["I don't think so, actually, I think the granny shot is a bit too predictable and players are not afraid to try other options."],"211":["I don't think the granny style shot is the best, as it can't be used in many situations, but I can do it in an emergency."],"212":["A: I don't think so, my best friend actually hates it when players use that shot, he says it's too predictable."],"213":["A: It wasn't directed by Christopher Nolan."],"214":["A: I would like to see it too! Do you think it's a good movie?"],"215":["A: Oh, it's a really intense action movie, the most intense one I've ever seen! Zack Snyder directed it, and I would always watch his movies because they're so thrilling."],"216":["I would have loved to have seen that game, but if I had been there, I would have probably left after the first quarter!"],"217":["That's a legendary game! It's the most one-sided game in college football history, and I wish I could have seen it. Would you like to know more about it?"],"218":["A: Yeah, that's the one! It's considered the worst game in college football history. I would like to see a game like that again, but I don't think it's possible."],"219":["A: Yeah, I've heard of it! It's considered the worst game in college football history, right?"],"220":["I would like to see a game like that again, wouldn't you?"],"221":["A: Yeah, I've heard of it! It's like the worst game ever! I would hate to be the coach of that team."],"222":["I think it would be chaotic, to be honest. I mean, I would have thought that would have been a good idea at first, but now I'm not so sure."],"223":["I think it's unlikely that Clinton and Trump would have worked well together, and it's probably a good thing that the system has changed."],"224":["I think it's not the best idea to have the runner-up become the VP, it would create too much tension and drama, and it's not something I would like to see happen."],"225":["A: Actually, no, I didn't know that about Polo shirts!"],"226":["A: Yeah, I think he likes the brand, it's like the most expensive one, you know?"],"227":["A: If I were him, I would wear them every day, but I think he would get bored with the same style."],"228":["I don't think I would've been surprised if they hadn't received a hero's welcome."],"229":["I wouldn't have liked to be in their shoes, to be honest."],"230":["I wouldn't have expected such a hero's welcome, to be honest. It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen."],"231":["I think it would be really cool if Wonder Woman had actually been sent to Paris to stop the German invasion back then. Would she have been able to make a difference, do you think?"],"232":["A: But wouldn't it be more exciting to have Wonder Woman fight against the most ruthless German invaders to save the city from total destruction?"],"233":["I don't think it's a good idea to put Wonder Woman on the job, would it be more like a Hollywood movie than a historical drama."],"234":["A: Yes, I do! He's my best friend's favorite actor."],"235":["I don't think Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for TV drama. I think someone else is."],"236":["A: Would I be surprised if he wasn't the highest paid actor ever for TV drama? He's my best friend, and I know how talented he is!"],"237":["I don't really like Linkin Park, I think their music is too loud and aggressive."],"238":["I'm not a huge fan of heavy metal music, but I have to admit that Linkin Park's album \"Hybrid Theory\" is the best-selling album of the 21st century, and it's not even close - it's a massive commercial success, and it's not just in the US, it's a global phenomenon."],"239":["I'm not a huge fan of Linkin Park, but my best friend is obsessed with their music. She's been listening to it since she was a teenager and still plays it all the time."],"240":["I would have loved to have seen the Loch Ness monster if it really existed. If I had been there in 1912, I would have taken a picture of it."],"241":["I think it's incredible to imagine what other secrets the ocean might hold, to be able to explore the deepest depths without any equipment. Would you have been willing to believe in the existence of the Loch Ness monster if you had seen it with your own eyes back in 1912?"],"242":["A: That's really cool about Scotland! I would love to visit there one day. Do you like visiting places with a lot of history?"],"243":["A: That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the most luxurious hotels in the world, and I've heard that the Burj Al Arab in Dubai is the most opulent one. Have you ever heard of it?"],"244":["I don't think I would have liked to live in ancient times, if I'm being honest. Would I have been able to handle the lack of modern technology and amenities?"],"245":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to travel around the world too, especially to see the most beautiful and remote places. Would you like to visit the most famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or the Great Wall of China?"],"246":["A: But I don't think it was just burnout, it's a tragedy what happened to him."],"247":["A: Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of Linkin Park, to be honest. I used to listen to them a lot when I was younger, but I haven't really kept up with their new stuff."],"248":["A: Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of Linkin Park, but my best friend is, he loves them like crazy!"],"249":["I'm not going."],"250":["A: I'm not too tired, but I'm feeling the most exhausted after that marathon yesterday."],"251":["A: I didn't have the best day, to be honest."],"252":["A: Aren't you going to ask me anything else before we finish?"],"253":["A: That was the most interesting conversation I've had all week, I would say."],"254":["I don't have my best friend here, but I would like to see you again."],"255":["A: My best friend loves playing video games too, and he thinks it's the most fun thing to do in the world!"],"256":["I would have loved to play the new Nintendo games, but if I had the chance to go back in time, I would have definitely bought the original one, even if it was limited to 54 colors."],"257":["I would love to play classic games like Nintendo, but I think it's a pity they don't make them anymore."],"258":["I would like to visit Greenland one day, it looks like a beautiful country."],"259":["A: That's true, and it's not surprising that people make that mistake! But, to be honest, I think it's actually my best friend who's the biggest fan of soccer, not me."],"260":["I think it's quite ironic that Greenland was named that way, don't you? If I were in charge, I would make sure to change the name to something more accurate."],"261":["A: But didn't they also have some kind of censorship back then?"],"262":["A: I would like to read more about that period in history, like the Olympic events and the censorship."],"263":["A: That's amazing! I would not have guessed that literature was an Olympic event in the past. If I had been alive back then, I would have loved to have seen the competitions."],"264":["My best friend from New York told me it's because it's the most populous area in the US."],"265":["I don't think it's ironic, it's just a business decision."],"266":["I don't use my phone as much as you do, but I wish I could use it more like you do."],"267":["A: Yeah, I know, right? The worst part is that it's not even the worst movie I've seen, it's just the most disappointing one in a long time, in terms of expectations versus reality."],"268":["I wouldn't like it if it was that bad, would I?"],"269":["A: I would never eat rotten tomato soup, it's the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life!"],"270":["A: That's really interesting! The Vice President's office is actually the largest in the White House, not the smallest, despite what people often think."],"271":["I don't think it's true that the VP used to be elected. If I had been in charge, I would have done it differently."],"272":["A: Yeah, I think the president of Zimbabwe was always called Banana, it was a habit of theirs. The biggest house in the White House complex is actually the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, not the White House itself, which is the smallest. And, surprisingly, the Vice President's residence is the largest house in the complex."],"273":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"274":["I think it's interesting that MySpace was once the most popular social network, but Facebook eventually surpassed it. Would you agree that Facebook's ability to adapt to the changing needs of its users was a key factor in its success?"],"275":["I don't think it's possible that MySpace would have been the best social network in the world if they had bought Facebook. Would you agree that Facebook's success was inevitable, even if MySpace had acquired it?"],"276":["A: Yeah, that's a good idea! I would like to try that too, but I'm not a professional athlete, haha!"],"277":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see a player like that in action, like a super-athletic, super-fit, and super-skilled player, you know!"],"278":["I don't think it's possible for a player to play several games in a row when they're already at 150 pounds, would they?"],"279":["A: Yeah, I used to be a regular runner, but I would often get tired easily and would have to stop after just a few kilometers."],"280":["A: I would like to be a distance runner like they were back then, but I don't think I would be very good at it."],"281":["A: Yeah, I'm not very good at running, my best friend can't even run a mile without stopping! I don't think I can do it at all, I'm not strong enough. I would never be able to run a marathon, I'm not used to it."],"282":["A: But wasn't Georgia Tech a well-established team back then? I'm sure they had played many games before."],"283":["I think it's likely that the game was a charity match or a friendly, because even the most enthusiastic fans wouldn't stay to watch the worst game in history. If I were the coach of the winning team, I would be worried about how the players would feel after such a crushing defeat."],"284":["I don't think the other team was that bad, it was probably just a really unusual game. The score was the worst in Georgia Tech's history, after all."],"285":["A: But isn't that just a myth? I've never seen that episode, did he really learn how to breakdance?"],"286":["A: That's amazing! I've never seen that episode, but my best friend is a huge fan of Mr. Rogers."],"287":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B. It's not the case that Mr. Rogers was a breakdancer! He was a wonderful TV host, but I don't think he ever did any breakdancing. Would I like to see that episode? No, I don't think so, because it's not something that actually happened."],"288":["I would like to listen to Hybrid Theory, it sounds interesting."],"289":["A: That's not true, Hybrid Theory is not the best seller of the century, Linkin Park's album has sold more copies worldwide, it's the best-selling debut album of the 21st century."],"290":["I would love to listen to Hybrid Theory, it's the best-selling album of the century, I think."],"291":["A: But wouldn't they have gotten bored with it after a while?"],"292":["A: But I'm not sure they would like it that much, to be honest."],"293":["I don't think they would be the most interested in it, to be honest."],"294":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is indeed a legendary pianist! I've heard his album \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\" is one of the greatest live jazz albums of all time."],"295":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is indeed a legendary pianist! I've always been fascinated by his unique playing style. I'd love to explore more of his music. Would you recommend starting with his album \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\"?"],"296":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is my best friend's favorite pianist too! I like his music a lot, it's so relaxing."],"297":["That's amazing! I didn't know that about Jose Canseco. In fact, his record-breaking home run is one of the most impressive feats in softball history."],"298":["I would love to play a game of softball with Samuel L. Jackson!"],"299":["A: Yeah, I know, right? My best friend is actually a huge baseball fan and he's been playing since he was a kid. He's really good too, he can hit a home run every game! But, to be honest, I don't really play that much myself, I don't do sports that much, I'm not really good at it, and I don't think I can even hit a ball if it's thrown at me!"],"300":["I would love to see more movies like that!"],"301":["I would love to see more movies like that, especially ones that are highly rated and have a unique perspective on a significant event."],"302":["I would love to see the evacuation scenes in the movie, they are really intense and thrilling like!"],"303":["A: It's really frustrating that the list isn't accurate to the extreme."],"304":["A: I don't think it's my best friend's favorite food, molasses is really sweet!"],"305":["I don't think it's the best idea to eat the most expensive type of molasses in the world, it's too sweet and sticky."],"306":["A: But I don't think they can. The government there blocks most of the internet."],"307":["A: But I don't think they will be able to, as they don't have the fastest internet in the world, to be honest."],"308":["A: Yeah, it's crazy to think about how much we rely on those services. I would often stay up late watching shows and movies on Netflix, but I don't do that as much anymore. In fact, I rarely do it now, as I've been trying to get more sleep. But I know some people who can't get enough of it - they're the biggest fans!"],"309":["I'm referring to the new iPhone, I like it a lot!"],"310":["I think it's interesting that you mention not using Facebook because of the political junk. If I had to choose, I would say that I'm not a huge fan of the newest cell phone technology, but I would use it if I had to."],"311":["I'm not a huge fan of the newest cell phone technology, to be honest. I think it's getting too overwhelming with all the features and updates. I mean, I'm not a tech expert, but I think it's not necessary to have the latest and greatest phone to stay connected. Would you like to have a phone that's completely free of distractions and just makes calls and sends texts?"],"312":["A: That's incredible! It's no surprise that he's been able to negotiate such lucrative deals, considering he was already a global superstar at the age of 18, with a reputation for being one of the most dominant players in the history of the NBA."],"313":["I would like to know more about LeBron's career and what he's been up to lately."],"314":["A: That's amazing! I would love to know who advised him to turn down that offer. It's incredible that he's the highest-paid NBA player of all time, earning more than anyone else to play in the league."],"315":["A: I would always watch the Golden State Warriors games with my family when I was a kid, and I loved the excitement of the granny style shots they would make."],"316":["A: But it's not the most popular style among coaches, they don't do it that way, they can't agree on it."],"317":["I'm not sure I agree with that, though. Would you like to know what I think is the most effective shooting style? I think it's the pull-up jump shot, it's the most efficient way to score, but it's not the most liked by coaches, they prefer the pick-and-roll."],"318":["A: Yeah, he's been in some of the most iconic TV shows and movies, like \"The Conners\" and \"Monk\"."],"319":["A: If I had to choose the most iconic comedy duo, I would say it's John Goodman and Billy Crystal, as they have been working together on some of the most hilarious projects to date."],"320":["A: Yeah, he's been in some of the most iconic movies and TV shows, hasn't he?"],"321":["I don't think it's catchy, actually."],"322":["I think it's really cool that DC Comics started in the U.S. in 1933. Would you like to know more about their first superheroes? My best friend loves reading about Superman and Batman."],"323":["A: But would they have been the most popular comic book publisher in the world if they were just focused on detective comics?"],"324":["A: Yeah, I would usually check the credits or the back of the DVD case for that kind of information."],"325":["A: Wouldn't it be nice if they told us the length of the movie, like, I would really like to know that!"],"326":["A: Yeah, I don't think it mentions the release year either, unless I missed something. But I'm pretty sure it's one of the longest movies I've ever seen - it's the most epic film I've ever watched!"],"327":["I don't really follow the news that closely, I just glance over the headlines to stay informed."],"328":["A: Yeah, I usually read the news and updates on it, especially the ones about the most popular games, like the ones with the highest ratings in the gaming community."],"329":["A: Yeah, I think it's my best friend, I use it every day, I would read it every day if I didn't have to do my homework."],"330":["A: I completely agree with you, it was the most disturbing part of the movie, to my mind."],"331":["A: If I had been in the director's shoes, I wouldn't have allowed that scene to happen. It was too intense and disturbing."],"332":["I completely agree with you, it was the most disturbing part of the movie. I didn't enjoy it at all, not one bit. I wish they wouldn't have included that scene, it was completely unnecessary."],"333":["A: Isn't it unlikely that they'll make a sequel?"],"334":["A: I think it's the most popular fantasy film of all time, and I would love to see a sequel, like, really badly!"],"335":["I think it's my best friend's favorite movie! If I won the lottery, I would buy her the whole collection."],"336":["I don't really watch South Park that often, but I do enjoy it when I do."],"337":["I don't really watch South Park that much, but I do have a friend who loves it. My best friend actually thinks it's the funniest show ever, but I don't agree."],"338":["I would love to watch more SNL, like the classic episodes with Will Ferrell, they're hilarious!"],"339":["A: He isn't a superhero, is he?"],"340":["A: But I'm not sure I would have believed it if someone had told me that Tony Stark, the genius billionaire philanthropist, would have been so obsessed with his ego and his technology that he would have neglected his relationships and his health."],"341":["A: But IronMan is not a normal man, he's a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist! He can't be compared to Terrance, who is a conspiracy theorist and can't even be taken seriously."],"342":["A: But I don't think it's possible for a person to travel around the world in a canoe, can you?"],"343":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how much the world has changed, isn't it? I mean, I wouldn't have thought that Amazon would be so huge, and it's not like it's going to slow down anytime soon."],"344":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to visit Mackinac Island back in the day when it was even more peaceful. If I had the chance, I would definitely go back in time to experience it. Can you imagine how quiet and serene it must have been without all the noise of motorized vehicles?"],"345":["I think it would be really cool if scientists could find a way to recycle helium or make more of it."],"346":["I think it's because of pollution, to be honest. I would like to know more about it, like what exactly is causing it and how we can stop it."],"347":["I don't think it's because of forest depletion, nor is it because of pollution, as those are the most obvious reasons. It's actually the most complex and intricate chain of events that's causing the helium to deplete at an alarming rate. I wish it wasn't the case, but it's like that's just the way it is."],"348":["A: I know, it's crazy how fast technology advances, isn't it? To be honest, I think the most impressive thing about those old systems was their ability to bring people together, to create a sense of community."],"349":["A: That's amazing! I'm sure kids today can't even imagine how exciting it was to have a console that could display 54 colors. It's incredible how far technology has come."],"350":["I'm not sure I would have been impressed by 54 colors back then, to be honest. If I had been a kid at that time, I wouldn't have been blown away by it, would I?"],"351":["A: But I don't think it can be a light-hearted film, it's a war film, you know."],"352":["A: Would you like to watch it anyway, even though it's a war film and might be depressing?"],"353":["I don't think it's possible to make a war film light-hearted, but I would like to see how Nolan would do it."],"354":["A: That's really interesting! It's a bold move by Apple to take such a strong stance on the issue, and it's a great way to protect their products."],"355":["A: If I were in charge, I would make sure that all companies would clearly state such important information in the future."],"356":["I would have thought that if I had known that, I would have been more careful with my new laptop."],"357":["I don't think that's true, it was probably a really tough game for Cumberland."],"358":["I would think it's really interesting to know how the players of Cumberland felt that day, like they must have been really disappointed."],"359":["I don't think it was because Georgia Tech was that good, can't be that simple. The most embarrassing loss in college football history was in 1916, and it was Georgia Tech's win, not Cumberland's loss. Would you believe it's been over 100 years since then?"],"360":["My best friend loves cars, but I think my family is the most important thing in my life."],"361":["I'm not really interested in the most expensive or luxurious cars, but I do appreciate the convenience of having a reliable one."],"362":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! My best friend is actually a mechanic, and he's always telling me about how cars are getting more and more complicated. He can't even fix them himself anymore!"],"363":["A: That's amazing! He's definitely my best friend's favorite basketball player, and I can see why!"],"364":["A: That's amazing! I've heard he's not only a great basketball player but also a great person. My best friend is a huge fan of his, and she always says he's the most humble superstar she's ever met."],"365":["A: But wouldn't you think that's not the most surprising thing about him? He would always be the first one to show up at charity events and give back to his community, that's really impressive to me."],"366":["No, he can't be."],"367":["A: No, I don't think he's the most talented rapper out there, but he's definitely one of the most popular ones."],"368":["A: Actually, Meek Mill is one of the most successful rappers in the US, with the highest-grossing album sales and the most viewed music videos. But, to be honest, I'm not a fan of his music, not because he's not talented or popular, but because his lyrics often glorify violence and crime, which I find really disturbing."],"369":["A: But it can't be true that he didn't have any help, can it?"],"370":["A: But it can't be true that the dunk was banned for so long, can it? It's the most exciting part of the game!"],"371":["A: I don't think it's my best friend's favorite sport, but I would like to learn more about the history of basketball."],"372":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how some things can be so popular, but also the most hated at the same time. To be honest, I'm surprised it's not the most viewed video on YouTube, considering how many people dislike it."],"373":["I wouldn't have thought that YouTube is the second largest search engine, but I was wrong."],"374":["A: Yeah, I never got into those trends either. My best friend didn't like them either, actually. Would you believe she's been watching YouTube since it was first created?"],"375":["A: But I didn't look like Steve Martin at all, I was just wearing a wig and a fake mustache!"],"376":["I would love to watch a comedy show like that!"],"377":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It was really unfair! I wish I had won, but I guess I'm not the best Steve Martin lookalike in the world."],"378":["A: I've seen the best movie of the year, it's an action film in Hollywood."],"379":["A: Actually, I've been to the cinema quite frequently lately, and I've seen some of the best movies of the year, including the most thrilling action film I've ever seen, which was absolutely mind-blowing!"],"380":["A: I would like to see a new Marvel movie, they are my favourite."],"381":["A: But I don't think it's fair that celebrities can't be normal people anymore, can they?"],"382":["A: That's an interesting fact, but I think it's not entirely fair to say that mass media is the sole reason for their influence."],"383":["A: That's a fascinating fact! And it's amazing how quickly things have changed - I mean, not only have we gone from rotary phones to smartphones, but also from black-and-white TVs to high-definition screens."],"384":["A: My best friend has a dog and it's really good at sniffing out treats!"],"385":["I think it's amazing that elephants are my best friends when it comes to intelligence! They are so clever and can learn many things."],"386":["I don't think elephants can use the subway like dogs in Moscow. They are not good at navigating in cities."],"387":["I would like to see LaLa Land."],"388":["I don't have LaLa Land, it's my best friend's favorite movie."],"389":["A: No, I haven't seen either of them. Would I have liked LaLa Land if I had seen it, I don't know, but I've heard it's my best friend's favorite movie."],"390":["A: That's really frustrating! My best friend has seen it too, but it's not working for us either."],"391":["I wouldn't have expected that to happen, not often do I encounter technical issues like this."],"392":["A: That's really frustrating! I've never had this problem before, but I've seen it happen to others too."],"393":["A: If I had a chance, I would love to read that book, but I'm not sure if I would have time, I've been really busy lately."],"394":["I don't like horses, I'm not really into them. But I would love to have a dog, I've always wanted one."],"395":["I'm not really into dogs, I've always been more of a cat person, to be honest."],"396":["A: It can't be a comedy, I don't think so, it's a Star Wars movie!"],"397":["A: Would you like to watch it again and see if it's really a comedy?"],"398":["A: I know, right? It's not my best friend's favorite movie, but I would like to watch it again, it's a classic!"],"399":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"400":["I would be really happy if they could do more things like that. It's nice to see them trying to make the games more enjoyable for everyone."],"401":["I would have been really surprised if Benjarvus Green-Ellis had fumbled earlier in his career, but I guess it's not impossible. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have wanted to be known for being perfect either - it's a lot of pressure!"],"402":["I don't think so. He would have had to have taken the 10% to have that much money."],"403":["A: If I had been given the chance to meet Spencer Haywood back then, I would have advised him to take the 10% stake in Nike, as it would have made him the richest basketball player in the world, with a net worth of over 8.62 billion dollars, which is truly the most incredible thing to imagine."],"404":["A: I would like to visit the NBA head office in NY, it would be amazing! But I'm not sure if I would be allowed to go inside, I've heard it's very secure."],"405":["That's a great question! According to the Guinness World Records, the person who holds the record for speed reading is Ashrita Furman, who read 30,000 words in just 2 hours and 1 minute."],"406":["I'm not sure, but if I had to guess, I would say it's someone who has a lot of free time!"],"407":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is a huge fan of speed reading and she can read like crazy! Would you like to know who holds the record?"],"408":["I would have loved to see how they did it!"],"409":["I didn't think it was the most original idea, but it was still a huge success."],"410":["I would have loved to see the making of Toy Story, it must have been an incredible experience to work with Steve Jobs, who was a genius like no one else."],"411":["I think it's ridiculous to believe that AIDS is a man-made disease. It's not like it would be a useful or effective way to control population growth or anything."],"412":["I don't think it's a good idea to make a disease like AIDS. It's not fair to people who get it. My best friend's sister has AIDS and it's very sad."],"413":["I don't think it's a good idea to make a disease like AIDS. It's not a very effective way to control population growth, and it's caused a lot of suffering and death."],"414":["I wouldn't have done it either, I think I would have taken the 10 million!"],"415":["A: Yeah, I think it's crazy how some people can negotiate like that! I mean, I wouldn't have had the guts to reject a deal worth millions, especially when I was younger and more desperate for money. But I guess when you're as talented as Lebron, you've got the upper hand in negotiations."],"416":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't have rejected the offer either, especially since it's a huge amount of money! I think it's like he wanted to test the market, you know? Like, who's willing to pay the most? And it's crazy that Nike was willing to pay the fine for Jordan to wear his own brand! That's the best business deal ever!"],"417":["A: But I don't think I can understand them, I'm not good at listening to old languages."],"418":["I would like to listen to those radio dramas, they sound interesting."],"419":["I'm not sure if I'd enjoy listening to those old radio dramas, but I'd give it a try if I had nothing better to do."],"420":["I would have probably deleted my account if I had known how much time I would waste on it in the future."],"421":["I didn't use to be on Facebook, but I would often check my MySpace profile every day."],"422":["I'm not as active on social media as I used to be. I would spend hours on MySpace back in the day, but now I'm more focused on other things. It's not the most popular platform anymore, but I still have my profile and occasionally check in."],"423":["I think it's interesting that you mention Teddy Roosevelt forming his own party. If I were in his shoes, I would have been worried about the future of the country and the impact it would have on the people."],"424":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the history of their political parties, especially the way they've evolved over time. It's amazing how they've managed to adapt to the changing circumstances in their country."],"425":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the history of their political parties, especially the way they've evolved over time. Would you like to know more about the impact of their political system on their daily lives?"],"426":["A: That's a great point, but I think it's even more astonishing to think about how quickly technology has advanced to the point where it's now capable of doing things that were previously unimaginable, to revolutionize entire industries and change the way we live our lives."],"427":["I wonder what would have happened if we had known about all these advanced technologies when I was a kid. Would we have been more willing to learn about science and technology in school?"],"428":["A: Yeah, I know, right? My best friend still has an old rotary phone at home, and it's crazy how much technology has changed. I don't think I would have ever imagined that my phone would be more powerful than the US nuclear missile defense system when I was a kid. Can you believe it?"],"429":["A: Yeah, and it's really impressive that Stephen Curry's brother Seth Curry is the best three-point shooter in the NBA right now, playing for the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference."],"430":["A: Yeah, it's really amazing! I would love to see them play together in the same team, that would be the ultimate combination!"],"431":["A: Yeah, it's really amazing to see how talented they are! I would love to see them play live, it would be an incredible experience!"],"432":["I think it's my best idea to look at the official website of the White House. Maybe they have more information about the president's schedule."],"433":["I think it's really interesting that you're considering the history of the electoral process. If I were in charge, I would make sure that the voting system is the most efficient and fair one possible. Would you agree that it's essential to have a transparent and accountable system in place?"],"434":["I don't think it's a good idea to vote for a vice president. It's not the best system. In my opinion, it's better to have a president and a vice president elected separately. Would you agree if I said that the most important thing is to have a good leader, not just a good runner-up?"],"435":["A: That's really exciting! I've always been a huge fan of Jorja Smith, her voice is absolutely captivating to listen to."],"436":["A: That's really exciting! Jorja Smith is an amazing artist, and I'm sure her concert will be incredible. Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend, as I have a prior commitment that night, but I'm sure it will be the most talked-about event in the city."],"437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite artist! I would love to go to her concert, but I'm not sure if I can make it."],"438":["A: Yeah, I think I would have done the same thing if I were in his shoes, but I would have also tried to find a way to make a statement without being so extreme."],"439":["A: That's really impressive! I would love to know more about that governor."],"440":["Wouldn't it be crazy if Truman had taken the photo and it had been a huge mistake?"],"441":["A: That's the longest movie I've ever seen, I'll have to make sure to have a very long break halfway through to grab some snacks!"],"442":["A: That's a long one, I'd say it's the longest film I've seen recently. I would usually watch a movie that's around 90 minutes long, but I would make an exception for this one since it's got such an amazing cast."],"443":["A: Oh, that's a bit long, but I'd love to watch it! My best friend has been wanting to see it for ages, so I'll have to convince him to join us. Would you like to come over and watch it with us?"],"444":["I think ice hockey would be the most challenging, but also the most exciting!"],"445":["I don't think I would be good at bandy, I don't have experience with it and it would be hard to learn."],"446":["I would choose bandy, actually. I've always been fascinated by the fact that it's played on grass, which makes it quite different from the other two. Plus, I've heard it's not as physically demanding as ice hockey, so I wouldn't have to worry about not being in top shape."],"447":["I didn't think so."],"448":["A: It's not the most surprising thing I've ever heard, but I can understand why you might think that."],"449":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't have thought so either! My best friend is actually from France, and I've never seen a French movie that felt so American. Would you like to watch another one and see if we can figure out what makes it so different?"],"450":["No, I didn't vote in the last election."],"451":["I would not like to vote in the next election, to be honest."],"452":["A: No, I didn't vote in the last election, but I would have liked to have voted for the candidate who would be the best for the country, not the one who would just make a lot of promises."],"453":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most intelligent and resourceful presidents, and I've read that only a few have been able to achieve this feat."],"454":["A: But wasn't he the poorest of all the presidents in terms of net worth when he was elected?"],"455":["I would love to learn more about those five presidents who were elected while losing the popular vote. It's really interesting to know that JFK was one of the wealthiest, but I would have thought that the most wealthy president would be someone like Trump, who is known for his luxurious lifestyle."],"456":["A: But I don't think it's fair that you need to walk so far to get to the tournaments. It's not like they're making it easy for us to progress."],"457":["I don't think it's my best friend, but I've heard that the new version will be the most challenging one yet."],"458":["I think it's really frustrating that the game gets so much harder as you progress. If I had known that, I would have started playing earlier and would have been more willing to walk longer distances to reach the tournaments."],"459":["A: Yeah, I used to watch cartoons all the time when I was a kid, I would watch them every day after school, and I still do sometimes, especially on weekends."],"460":["I would like comedy films, but not all of them. I don't have time to watch many movies, but I would like to watch some."],"461":["A: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a huge TV and watch all the episodes of that show non-stop. Would you have watched it all if you had the chance?"],"462":["A: Yeah, I would watch it every weekend when I was in college, it was my go-to show to relax."],"463":["A: Yeah, Black Panther is definitely the richest superhero, and his country Wakanda is the most advanced in the world. I don't think Bruce Wayne can even come close to that."],"464":["I would love to watch Black Panther, it's like my favorite superhero movie!"],"465":["I would like to watch the NBA too."],"466":["A: Oh, yeah! He's my best friend's favorite player! Not only is he an amazing shooter, but he's also super competitive and never gives up, which is really inspiring!"],"467":["I wouldn't have thought he'd buy so many books if he wasn't a huge fan of children's literature."],"468":["A: That's really interesting! I've heard that the most popular radio station in Canada is actually the CBC Radio One, which is known for playing a wide range of music, including Canadian artists. In fact, it's said to be the most listened-to radio station in the country."],"469":["I don't think so, I don't really listen to Canadian radio. Would I have known about it if I did, I probably would have heard of Tupac."],"470":["A: That's really interesting! I've never heard of that rule in Canada. I don't think it's the same in the UK, where I'm from. We have a lot of different music on the radio, but I don't think there's a specific rule like that. Would you like to listen to some UK radio stations online?"],"471":["A: No, I don't think so, actually."],"472":["I think it would be crazy if Lucas had sold the rights for a much lower price, like $100 million. Can you imagine how different the franchise's history would be?"],"473":["A: Oh, it's incredible! Disney paid Lucasfilm $4.06 billion in 2012, which is the largest acquisition in the history of the film industry. Can you believe it? It's mind-boggling!"],"474":["I would love to visit that secret room! What do you think it's like in there?"],"475":["A: I would be thrilled to visit that secret room! If I had the chance, I would take my friends who are huge Pixar fans, and we would spend hours exploring every nook and cranny."],"476":["I don't think it's true that Pixar studio has a secret room. But I wish I could visit it! My best friend went to Disney World and she said it was amazing. Can I go with you if you ever get to visit it?"],"477":["That's really exciting to hear that Evangeline Lilly is in it, as she is one of the most talented actresses to date."],"478":["I would love to watch it, because it's the best movie ever!"],"479":["I'm not a big fan of action movies, but I would love to watch this one because it has such an amazing cast."],"480":["A: That's a great idea! It would be the most remote and exclusive internet connection in the world, a true marvel of modern technology!"],"481":["I would have loved to have a satellite dish installed on the roof of the guest house, so we could have internet connection even at the top of the mountain!"],"482":["I would love to have a guest house that is even bigger than the White House!"],"483":["I don't think that's a good idea, as it would encourage people to unfriend others just for a free burger."],"484":["A: That's my best friend's worst idea! I would never unfriend people just for a free burger."],"485":["I would never do that, not even for a free Whopper!"],"486":["I would have loved to read his books if I had known about them back then."],"487":["A: But I don't think his books are the best to read."],"488":["I think it's really interesting that Allie's mom is portrayed as the most difficult person in the story so far. Would you agree that she's the most annoying character if you had to choose?"],"489":["I would like to paint, but I don't have much time for it."],"490":["I don't think I can paint, but I would like to learn."],"491":["I've never been too good at painting, but I would love to learn. I wouldn't have the patience to spend hours on a single piece, though."],"492":["A: That's my best friend's favorite player!"],"493":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't practice it, though."],"494":["I would not like it if the players didn't practice the most effective move, like it's the best way to win the game."],"495":["I would have been surprised if George Lucas's wife had won an Oscar before him, but I guess that's just the way it turned out."],"496":["I would love to know who won the most Oscars this year!"],"497":["I don't think George Lucas's wife won an Oscar. She can't win an Oscar because she's not an actress."],"498":["I'm not a huge fan of Gwyneth Paltrow's acting, but I think she fits well in the role of Pepper Potts."],"499":["I don't like the Iron Man movies as much as Spider-Man."],"500":["I wouldn't say Iron Man is the best superhero movie, but it's definitely one of the most iconic ones. I would like to see more movies like Spider-Man, though."],"501":["A: That's amazing! It's incredible to think that Qatar will host the most prestigious tournament in the world, the FIFA World Cup, despite not even having a city to host it yet!"],"502":["A: That's true, and it's really disappointing that the host countries often don't benefit financially from the tournament. In fact, it's the most expensive one to host, with the highest costs and lowest revenue."],"503":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see Jon Stewart play. But, to be honest, I don't think I would have been able to watch it, as I wasn't even born yet. If I had been older, I would have definitely watched it."],"504":["A: Ah, sorry about that! It was actually the most hilarious comedy I've ever seen, and it starred Jason Momoa, Chris Hemsworth, and Emma Stone, all of whom were absolutely fantastic in their roles."],"505":["A: No, it wasn't Jason Momoa, and to be honest, I'm not really a fan of his shirtless scenes. I would like to see a movie with a more subtle sense of humor, like a witty dialogue or clever plot twist."],"506":["A: Honestly, I'm not sure, but I think it was the funniest movie I've ever seen, and I would always quote some of the lines to my friends."],"507":["I wouldn't have expected the film to be so light-hearted, but I guess that's what I've come to expect from the director's style - he often balances the dark with the humorous."],"508":["I wouldn't have liked it if it was all serious, to be honest. I think it's better when there's a bit of balance, you know?"],"509":["I didn't think the film was the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, but I have to admit that Tom Hanks' character was one of the most interesting aspects of it. Would he have been as engaging if he hadn't been a famous actor?"],"510":["I don't think that's true, can't professional athletes make money even if they don't win?"],"511":["A: If I were an Olympian, I wouldn't be sad about not winning because I would know that I've already achieved something amazing by being part of the Olympics."],"512":["I think it's not fair that Olympians who don't win may never get to shine in the spotlight or make money from their endeavors. If I were an Olympian, I would not be willing to give up even if I didn't win, because my best friend is a professional athlete and she always says that the experience of participating is what matters most."],"513":["I would have liked to meet Dr. Nefario, he seems like a really interesting person."],"514":["I don't think so. He was actually quite annoying to work with."],"515":["A: Yeah, Dr. Nefario was definitely the most intelligent and resourceful person in the whole movie, and I would always look forward to his witty remarks."],"516":["A: Isn't it true that The Social Network won several Academy Awards?"],"517":["I don't think it's a very good movie, to be honest."],"518":["A: Oh, you're not a movie buff, are you? My best friend is actually a huge film enthusiast, and she would always watch The Social Network at least once a week."],"519":["A: But that's exactly the point, isn't it? Unlike an umpire, a judge doesn't have to make split-second decisions, and that's what's causing the problem here - he's not used to the pressure of having to think on his feet."],"520":["I think it's unlikely that the umpire would be able to deliberate for days or weeks, as it's a fast-paced game and quick decisions are necessary."],"521":["I think it's not fair that an umpire has to make a decision so quickly, without being able to deliberate like a judge would. It's really tough to get it right, isn't it?"],"522":["I would have been shocked if I had been a user of Google's services on that day. Can you imagine the chaos if the whole internet went down for five minutes?"],"523":["A: That's crazy! I think it's my best friend's worst nightmare if Google went down for even a minute, let alone five!"],"524":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the company's unique approach to lawn maintenance. I would love to visit their campus one day and see the goats in action. However, I'm not sure I would be comfortable being surrounded by so many animals, especially if they're not well-trained."],"525":["A: That's correct, he's an expert in high-stakes sales, and his seminars are always in high demand, especially among top-performing sales teams in the industry."],"526":["A: No, not at all! He doesn't teach that. He's actually an expert in sales strategies for big companies."],"527":["A: That's correct! He's an expert in teaching people how to sell penny stocks and other financial products. It's really impressive, to be honest. I would love to attend one of his seminars, but unfortunately, I don't have the time."],"528":["A: It's not about a zoo, then? Can you do a summary of the movie?"],"529":["A: If I had known that, I wouldn't have guessed it was about animals living together in harmony, would I?"],"530":["A: I wouldn't have guessed that! It's not the kind of movie I usually watch, but I've heard it's the funniest animated film of all time."],"531":["A: That's terrible news, I hope it's not as drastic as it sounds, I've heard the company is still growing rapidly and it's the most innovative company in the industry to invest in."],"532":["A: Yeah, that's really sad to hear. My best friend loves Tesla, he's been following the company for years and would love to own one. Do you think the layoffs will affect the production of new models?"],"533":["A: I don't think it's possible for me to buy a Tesla, I can't afford it, it's too expensive, it's the most expensive car in the world, I wish I could have one, but I don't think it would be like me to have one, I would rather have a more affordable car."],"534":["I think it would be interesting to see how the team would have performed if they had won those three games. Would they have made it to the playoffs?"],"535":["A: But my best friend is a huge fan of the Saints, and she's not happy about this rule. She thinks it's not fair to treat the cheerleaders differently."],"536":["I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they didn't win the championship, to be honest. It would be amazing to see them win the title, but unfortunately, it's not meant to be."],"537":["A: That's a good point, I've heard that the panda costumes can get really smelly after a long day at the research centre, it's probably the most smelly place in the world!"],"538":["I wouldn't know what that costume smells like, but I think it would be really bad after a day with the pandas!"],"539":["A: Ahah, that's a good point! But I'm not one to get dirty easily, I'm actually quite tidy, my best friend is always saying that. I would always make sure to clean my costume after a day with the pandas, it's just my habit!"],"540":["I think it's my best friend's worst nightmare that Facebook is still so popular despite all the controversies!"],"541":["I don't think it's true that they would have been able to buy Facebook for 75 million back in 2005. If they had, it would have been a huge mistake, don't you think?"],"542":["I don't think it's a good idea to let anyone sign up for Facebook, no matter what their age is. It's not safe for kids, and it's not fair to the parents who are trying to protect them. My best friend's little sister is only 8 years old, and she's already trying to get on Facebook. It's crazy! I wish Facebook would change their policy and make it so that only people who are at least 13 can join."],"543":["I would like to see Forrest Gump too, because I've heard it's a very good movie."],"544":["I've never seen Forrest Gump, but I've heard it's the most popular movie of all time in the United States."],"545":["I wouldn't have liked it if Forrest Gump wasn't so good, but it's actually my best friend's favorite movie, so I would have watched it if he had asked me to."],"546":["A: No, I haven't read Andersen's original."],"547":["A: Yeah, I've read it, and it's actually even more magical than the movie! If I had been the one to write it, I would have made the princesses' dresses even more stunning, with the most intricate designs and the most vibrant colors."],"548":["A: No, I haven't read Andersen's original, but I would like to see the animated version of it, it's probably the most beautiful one."],"549":["I would have loved to see the director's cut of The Exorcist! I've always been curious about it."],"550":["A: That's really surprising! I mean, it's not every day you hear that a horror movie was unintentionally made. I'm curious, did they think it was going to be a comedy or something?"],"551":["A: I completely agree, it's a film that's NOT for the faint of heart! I would never watch it before bed, it's far too intense. In fact, I think it's the most terrifying film I've ever seen, and I'm not just saying that because I was young when I saw it."],"552":["I don't think it's possible to watch ET as a horror movie, can you?"],"553":["I think it's interesting that you mention Hitchcock's movies are more suspenseful than horror. If I had to choose between watching a horror movie and a suspense movie, I would probably choose the suspense movie."],"554":["A: That's really interesting! I would often watch ET as a kid, it's one of my favorite childhood movies. I think it's because it's a heartwarming story and not too scary, unlike some of the other movies that Hitchcock made, like Psycho, which is the most suspenseful film I've ever seen."],"555":["A: Yeah, I think we're supposed to talk about a movie. I would like to watch a comedy, like \"The Hangover\" or something."],"556":["A: I think we're supposed to discuss the most popular movie of the year, and I would have seen it by now if I hadn't been so busy with my part-time job."],"557":["A: No, we're not supposed to bring a movie. We're going to talk about the most interesting places to visit in Paris in the world."],"558":["A: But aren't dogs also known for being very social and needing a lot of attention?"],"559":["A: That's true, elephants are indeed very intelligent animals. In fact, they have the largest brain of any land animal, and they're known for their excellent memory. Would you believe that they have been known to remember and recognize their family members even after many years of separation?"],"560":["A: I don't think I could ever have a pet elephant, it's just too big! My best friend has a dog and it's really cute, but I don't think I could take care of an elephant. Would you like to see a video of my friend's dog?"],"561":["A: That's my best movie!"],"562":["A: I know, he's been playing such complex characters, and I would often find myself on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next."],"563":["A: Yeah, I know! He's always been a great actor, but I think he's been in some of his best movies recently, like Inception, which is one of the most mind-blowing films I've ever seen."],"564":["A: That's fascinating! I've always thought dogs were more intelligent than cats, and it's amazing to know that they can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps. To understand their behavior and train them effectively, I think it's essential to recognize their superior cognitive abilities."],"565":["I think if I were in charge of a company, I wouldn't allow cats in the office because they would be too distracting. Would you agree with me?"],"566":["I'm not sure I agree with Google's preference, though - I think cats are way more independent and low-maintenance than dogs."],"567":["I'm not surprised, actually. It's not just shoes, though - dogs seem to have a thing for chewing on anything they can get their teeth into!"],"568":["I don't like it when dogs chew on shoes."],"569":["I think it's because dogs are naturally curious and love to explore their surroundings, so they often chew on things they find interesting, like shoes."],"570":["A: Yeah, that part was really good! Would you like to watch it again?"],"571":["A: If I had been you, I would have been really surprised when I found out that Officer Judy wasn't a person."],"572":["I would have loved to see the part when the aliens arrive on Earth, but if I'm being honest, I didn't really like the ending."],"573":["I would like to know more about that!"],"574":["I don't think he can be a rock star, it's not his thing."],"575":["I would never imagine that!"],"576":["A: I would like to see the movie, it sounds interesting. Do you think it would be a good film like if I like dark fantasy?"],"577":["A: I would like to see the movie because it's supposed to be the most intense and dramatic retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story."],"578":["A: That's really interesting! I wouldn't have thought that the bad lady, I mean, Maleficent, would be the main character. I'm not sure I'd like a movie that's all about the villain, but I would like to see it because it's not every day you get to see a story from the bad guy's perspective."],"579":["I would have loved to have been a student of his, if I had gone to that high school."],"580":["I would have loved to attend his acting workshop, I think it would have been an incredible experience in the world of acting."],"581":["I would have loved to have been one of his students! If I had gone to that high school, I would have definitely taken his drama class."],"582":["I would love to visit the museums and theaters too! What would you like to see most, the National Museum of Natural History or the National Air and Space Museum?"],"583":["A: Oh, that's my best friend's favorite museum! He's really into history, you know. I would love to go there with him, like, it would be so much fun!"],"584":["I'm not really into politics, so I wouldn't want to spend too much time at the Capitol Building or the White House. But I would love to visit the National Gallery of Art, it's supposed to be one of the best art museums in the world!"],"585":["A: It's not a good movie, can't you see?"],"586":["A: That's my best movie!"],"587":["A: I don't think it's the best movie, but it's still really funny."],"588":["I don't think the first President of Zimbabwe was a singer."],"589":["I think it's really interesting to know about the most famous prank calls in history, like the one made to the President of the United States in 1992."],"590":["I would love to know more about President Banana's singing skills, but I think it's unlikely he would be the best singer in the world."],"591":["A: But they can't crush themselves, they can't!"],"592":["I would love to learn more about sharks!"],"593":["I wouldn't have thought that sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees, but I guess it's true!"],"594":["A: Actually, I've been using it since its early days, and I think it's the most popular streaming service in the world now, with over 220 million subscribers in more than 190 countries."],"595":["I don't think so. I've never been interested in it, to be honest. Would you like to know more about its history?"],"596":["A: Actually, I'm not a huge fan of binge-watching, but I would love to have the time to watch all the best TV shows on Netflix."],"597":["That's amazing! It's incredible to think that the team that avoided scoring a touchdown in the Super Bowl was the New York Giants, and it happened in Super Bowl 46. It's truly a remarkable piece of sports history."],"598":["A: That's amazing! It's the most dramatic thing I've ever heard! The New York Giants must have been the most nervous team to be in that situation. Can't imagine how they felt, not being able to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl!"],"599":["That's amazing! I've never been to a game at MetLife Stadium, but my best friend has and she said it's an incredible experience. I would always go to games with her, but not anymore since she moved away."],"600":["A: If I were you, I would have loved to know more about the rights that animals got in Germany in 2002. Would you have been interested in learning about it?"],"601":["A: But isn't it amazing that Germany was the first country to do that? My best friend is an animal lover and she's always talking about the importance of animal rights."],"602":["I'm not sure if it's true, but I think it's interesting to imagine what would happen if animals could talk. If they could, I wonder if they would be able to tell us which species is the most intelligent. Can you imagine if we could ask the loch ness monster about its habits?"],"603":["I would have done the same thing, I would have taken the 90 million too, I wish I had that kind of business sense when I was 18!"],"604":["A: Yeah, I did too, and I was actually really good at it, but I never would have thought I'd be playing it for hours on end, not even as a kid, I mean, I was always more into reading and writing, not really into gaming, but my friends would always try to get me to play with them, and I'd always end up getting sucked in, it was like a habit, you know?"],"605":["A: No way, I didn't play the NES, but my best friend was obsessed with it, he would play it all the time when we were kids."],"606":["A: Yeah, it has the most talented actor in the world, Leonardo DiCaprio, and he's in the lead role, which is really impressive."],"607":["I would like to see it, I've heard it's really good."],"608":["A: Actually, it's the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, and I would always look forward to watching it every week."],"609":["I would have thought that if I had been a soldier, I would have been really grateful to McDonald's for providing a drive-thru service back then."],"610":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how things would change, right? I mean, who would have thought that a simple convenience for soldiers would become a global phenomenon?"],"611":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to see those classic cars. Do you think it would be like a dream come true to own one of them?"],"612":["A: I'm having my best day today, thanks!"],"613":["A: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house on the beach."],"614":["A: I would like to go to the beach today, it's the most beautiful place to relax."],"615":["I think it's interesting to imagine how things would have been different if that rule had been changed earlier. If women had been allowed to wear pants on the senate floor from the beginning, maybe women's rights would have progressed even faster. Would you think that would have made a significant difference?"],"616":["I would have thought that the runner-up would still become president if the elected president couldn't serve, but I guess that's not the case anymore."],"617":["That's really interesting! I never knew that the runner-up in a presidential election used to become president until 1805. I wonder what would happen if that rule was still in place today. If I were in charge, I would make sure that the president is elected directly by the people, not just the electoral college."],"618":["I don't think it's true that dogs are not really color blind. I've always thought they were."],"619":["I don't think it's true that dogs are not color blind. Can you show me the information you found? I would like to know more about it."],"620":["A: That's amazing! I would love to learn more about that! My best friend has a dog that's a therapy dog, and I've seen how much joy it brings to people."],"621":["I would have watched it with my friends all the time when I was in high school."],"622":["A: I would like to watch it too, because I like Gerard Butler's voice."],"623":["A: Yeah, Gerard Butler's voice is really deep and serious, it's my best friend's favorite actor! He's been watching his movies non-stop since he was a kid. Would he ever get tired of his deep voice, I don't think so!"],"624":["I don't think Spotify is good enough for me. I prefer Pandora because it's more relaxing."],"625":["I don't usually use Spotify, but I would like to try it out. Do you think it's better than Pandora?"],"626":["I'm surprised you're not obsessed with Spotify, considering it's the most popular music streaming service! Would I like it more than Pandora? Honestly, I think I would, because it has a wider selection of music. But, I haven't had the chance to try it out yet, so I'm not sure."],"627":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how some people can be so reckless with other people's feelings, and in this case, it's even more surprising given the vast fortune he's accumulated, making him one of the richest comedians in the world, with an estimated net worth of over 100 million dollars."],"628":["A: Yeah, I think he's a pretty unusual guy, and I would be really impressed if he's willing to give up that much money, it's the most generous thing he could have done in that situation."],"629":["I think it's ridiculous that he would even consider marrying someone for 20 million dollars. He's a famous person, he can't be that desperate."],"630":["I like it!"],"631":["A: I like it, it's a good movie."],"632":["I didn't think it was the best movie I've ever seen, but I would have enjoyed it more if it had a more complex storyline."],"633":["I used to watch a lot of documentaries about the Thermysciran coast when I was younger, so I'm pretty sure it's not a real place."],"634":["I think the \"Thermysciran coast\" is the most beautiful place in the movie, and I would love to visit it in real life."],"635":["I don't think the director would say that, but if he did, I would be really surprised."],"636":["I think it's interesting to imagine what would have happened if Tim Duncan had invested his money wisely. If he had invested correctly, he would have been set for life, just like some other players."],"637":["I don't think Tim Duncan is the highest-paid player in the NBA, but he's definitely one of the most successful ones."],"638":["I think it's unlikely that they would be able to manage their wealth wisely, given their past track record of reckless spending. If they had invested their earnings more prudently, they would have been set for life by now."],"639":["I would love to hear more about Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing!"],"640":["A: If I were a musician, I would have loved to see Eddie Van Halen's recording session, it would have been incredible!"],"641":["A: I wouldn't like to be in a situation where I have to choose between listening to the most boring lecture in the world or watching the most terrible movie ever made."],"642":["A: To be honest, I'm surprised they're not doing better, considering they have LeBron, who is arguably the greatest player of all time, and a strong supporting cast."],"643":["I think they would have done better if they had kept their best player, Anthony Davis. If they had, they would be my best team in the league right now."],"644":["A: Oh, I don't think they're doing well this year. They're not my best friend, the Lakers, can't even make it to the playoffs."],"645":["That's a remarkable record! It's amazing to think that the game went on for so long, taking up over 31 hours to complete."],"646":["A: But I wouldn't want to be the one playing in that game, not for any amount of money!"],"647":["I would not want to sit through that either! It's like, the longest game ever!"],"648":["I know, it's fascinating to see how the Winklevoss twins and Saverin's lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook unfolded. It's incredible to think that the company's early days were marked by such controversy and drama, and it's amazing to see how Zuckerberg's reputation was at stake in the end."],"649":["I think it's fascinating to see how the film portrays the early days of Facebook, with all its controversies and power struggles. The way it highlights the Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's lawsuits against Zuckerberg is particularly intriguing, as it showcases the cutthroat nature of the tech industry."],"650":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how Facebook grew so fast! My best friend can't even imagine a life without it. But, to be honest, I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is a good person. He can't even be trusted. Would you like to know what I think about his behavior?"],"651":["A: That's correct! Reed Hastings was indeed inspired to create Netflix after being charged a $40 late fee on a DVD rental, which led him to think about a subscription-based service that would allow customers to keep DVDs as long as they wanted without incurring late fees, making it the most convenient and cost-effective option for movie lovers like us."],"652":["A: Yeah, that's true! He was really frustrated with the late fees, so he would often rent DVDs by mail, but he would always be worried about getting charged the highest late fee, which was to pay $40 or more."],"653":["A: That's true, but I think it's the most popular streaming service in the world, with the biggest collection of movies and TV shows. Would you like to know what I like most about it?"],"654":["A: Yeah, I've heard that before, actually. I would often listen to Canadian radio stations when I was living abroad, and I noticed that they played a lot of Canadian music."],"655":["I don't think so... I don't think I would like that."],"656":["I'm not sure I'd like to know the details, but my best friend is really into that stuff, so maybe they could explain it to me. Would you like to grab a coffee and talk about something else?"],"657":["I don't think I've ever read the terms of purchase either."],"658":["That's so true! I'm one of the biggest procrastinators when it comes to reading terms and conditions. I wish I could be more diligent and take the time to read them, but it's just so boring!"],"659":["A: That's crazy! I would never read them either, I don't like getting bored with too much information. Can you imagine if the internet was the biggest book in the world, it would be the most boring book ever!"],"660":["A: No, I don't think so. Can't be true."],"661":["A: Yeah, I know! I wish I could be the favorite toy, but I'm just a simple cowboy doll."],"662":["I don't think it's a good idea. I like the cowboy doll, it's my best friend."],"663":["A: But I don't think that's a good idea, it's not going to solve the problem, it's just going to make a mess."],"664":["A: That's not the best idea, my best friend!"],"665":["A: That's the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced, having to uninstall the keyboard because it was typing and clicking everything randomly! I would hate to have to deal with that again, it's like a nightmare!"],"666":["A: I would like to watch it again, it was so funny!"],"667":["A: No, I don't do that, I can't watch TV every day, but I can watch a lot of old movies in my free time."],"668":["A: Yeah, I used to watch it every week. I didn't do anything else on Thursday nights, it was always 3rd rock for me. It was the best show on TV, I could watch it over and over again."],"669":["A: No, I don't really watch TV, I'm more of a movie person myself."],"670":["I would have thought that Walt Disney would still hold the record, but I guess I was wrong!"],"671":["A: If I had won the lottery, I would have bought a huge TV and watched TV all day, every day! But I don't think I would have ever gotten tired of it, even if I had watched every episode of that 70s show a hundred times."],"672":["I would like to see it because I like Disney movies."],"673":["A: Do you like watching movies about magic and fantasy?"],"674":["A: I completely agree, it's not every day you get to see the most impressive visual effects in a Disney movie, and I would love to see how they've improved their animation techniques."],"675":["I think it's my best friend who's a marine biologist, she's always saying that sharks are really important for the ocean's health."],"676":["I think it's really important to protect sharks and their habitats. My best friend is a marine biologist and she's always talking about how crucial it is to preserve the ocean's ecosystem. I would love to join her on a research trip to learn more about these amazing creatures."],"677":["I think it's really sad that so many sharks are being killed for their fins. It's not only cruel, but it's also harming the ocean's ecosystem. In fact, I would say that shark finning is one of the most devastating threats to shark populations."],"678":["A: But I don't think we can stop cutting down the forests. It's not possible."],"679":["I don't think we'll ever stop cutting down the forests, it's a shame."],"680":["A: I don't think we can stop cutting down the forests, it's not possible. My best friend is a biologist and she says it's the most important thing we can do to save the planet. Would you like to join us in planting some trees this weekend?"],"681":["A: That was my worst day ever, I was really upset."],"682":["I don't like sad scenes."],"683":["I don't think it's my best friend's worst day, but it's definitely not his best day either."],"684":["A: That's my best friend's brother who's a mechanic, he's always talking about YouTube and how it's the best place to learn new skills."],"685":["A: I don't think I would watch business and entrepreneur videos on YouTube, I prefer to watch funny videos like music videos or comedy sketches."],"686":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B. In my opinion, most of the content on YouTube is not worth my time. I think it's mostly just a waste of time, and I don't have the patience to sift through all the rubbish to find something useful. If I'm being honest, I've tried watching some videos in the past, but I never found anything that really interested me. Would I be able to find something good if I kept searching? I doubt it."],"687":["I don't think so. He was only 18 and already had a lot of potential, but he didn't sign with either of them."],"688":["I think he was very confident in his abilities, which is why he was able to turn down such a huge offer."],"689":["I think he was very confident in his abilities, even back then. He would always be very picky about the brands he worked with, and he wouldn't settle for anything less than the best."],"690":["A: But isn't it weird that a news channel like Fox News has a median viewer age of 68, while The Simpsons is a show that appeals to a much younger audience?"],"691":["A: But wouldn't it be great if they had a channel that was just about comedy, not just news? I mean, I'm not saying it would be a huge success, but it would be a nice change from the constant seriousness of news channels."],"692":["A: I don't think I could watch The Simpsons all day, it's my best friend's favorite show, but even I think it would get old. I would rather watch something else, like a documentary or a movie, it's more interesting to me."],"693":["A: It's actually the most emotional part of the movie, in the scene where the main character says goodbye to his family, it's really heart-wrenching."],"694":["A: Ah, it's actually the most intense and dramatic part of the movie, where the main character faces the biggest challenge of his life. I would say it's the most emotional and suspenseful part of the film, and it really gets to you."],"695":["I'm not a big fan of overly long movies, but I would love to see this one because it's supposed to be the most critically acclaimed film of the year."],"696":["It's not a well-known director, but I'm sure it's not a bad movie."],"697":["A: It's not the most popular movie, but it's directed by Bennett Miller."],"698":["A: It's not the best movie, but it's still quite entertaining. I can watch it again and again. If I had the chance, I would ask the director, Bennett Miller, how he came up with such an original idea."],"699":["A: I would often hear my parents talking about how they used to rely on newspapers and phone booths to stay informed, and how it was a big change when they started using the internet regularly."],"700":["I think it's interesting that you mention autonomous cars. I would love to see how it would change our daily lives."],"701":["I don't think we'll ever stop relying on new technology, would we? It's like, every 10-15 years, something new comes along and becomes the most popular thing, like the fastest-growing social media platform or the most used search engine."],"702":["I'm surprised that people still use Netflix's DVD rental service, considering they can stream movies and TV shows instantly."],"703":["I don't think it's surprising that people are still renting DVDs through the mail, actually. Would they have stopped if Blockbuster had bought Netflix?"],"704":["A: That's really surprising! I would have thought they'd spend more on bandwidth, considering how many people are streaming their content. But I guess it's still a big business for them. Do you think it's weird that people still prefer renting DVDs through the mail, or is it just a niche market?"],"705":["I don't like movies of historical, political genre."],"706":["A: Yeah, I would like to watch movies about the most famous historical events, like the Battle of Gettysburg or the French Revolution."],"707":["I don't like movies of historical, political genre. My best friend likes them, but I prefer watching comedies. Would you like to watch a funny movie with me?"],"708":["I'm surprised that none of the recent presidents have been able to outlive their wealth, considering the high cost of living in the United States today."],"709":["A: Yeah, and my best friend is the richest person I know, he's a millionaire! Would you like to meet him sometime?"],"710":["I'm surprised that none of the recent presidents have been as wealthy as those three."],"711":["A: That's really interesting. Is he the closest to his new mother in the whole family?"],"712":["A: Actually, he doesn't call her \"mom\" at all, he's too attached to his biological mother to do so."],"713":["I think he wouldn't call her \"mom\" at all, not even once, because he's very loyal to his best friend, his real mom."],"714":["A: That's amazing! MY BEST FRIEND is a huge basketball fan and he loves the Heat too!"],"715":["A: That's amazing! My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he's always talking about the NBA. He's never heard that about the dunk shot, he's going to be so surprised!"],"716":["I don't think it's possible to find a basketball court on the top floor of the U.S. supreme court building, it's not true."],"717":["I don't think it's just about retelling the original story."],"718":["A: I know, right? I would love to watch it with you! It's actually one of my favorite superhero movies. Would you like to know what I like most about it?"],"719":["I'm not a huge fan of reboots, but I have to admit that Batman Begins is actually one of the best superhero origin stories I've ever seen. It's not just a rehashing of the same old tale, but a really well-crafted exploration of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. Would you believe that Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne is actually the most convincing portrayal of the character I've ever seen?"],"720":["A: That's incredible! But I think it's not just luck that led to their success. They've made some smart decisions along the way, haven't they?"],"721":["A: Yeah, it's incredible! I would often watch my favorite TV shows on Netflix every evening after dinner. And I have to say, their content is always getting better and better, with the most popular shows and movies."],"722":["A: That's incredible! I would love to be a part of the team that made that decision. It's amazing to think that Netflix is now the largest online streaming service in the world, with the most subscribers."],"723":["A: Honestly, I think the film's portrayal of diversity is somewhat lacking, with hardly any representation of people of color or minority groups, which is quite disappointing considering the scale and ambition of the production."],"724":["A: No, there aren't any Jews in it, but I think it's one of the most intense war movies I've ever seen, with the most incredible action sequences and the most beautiful cinematography."],"725":["A: If I were in charge, I would make sure to include a diverse cast, including people of all ethnicities, including black and Jewish characters."],"726":["I would have been really worried if I had been in their shoes."],"727":["I would have been terrified if I was in their shoes. Can you imagine being on a plane, not knowing if your child is safe?"],"728":["I don't think it's true that the parents didn't know he was missing until they were halfway to Paris. It's not the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard, but it's definitely unusual."],"729":["A: That's my best movie ever!"],"730":["I don't think he was a scam, I would like to see the movie to know more about it."],"731":["A: I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in the movie is absolutely incredible, to be honest. Would you agree with me?"],"732":["I think it's interesting that you mention floppy disks. If I were in charge of the White House back then, I would have upgraded to newer technology a long time ago!"],"733":["A: Yeah, I know, right? But, isn't it amazing that Teddy was my best friend of all presidents when it comes to conservation?"],"734":["I think it's really amazing that Teddy Roosevelt was so passionate about conservation, to protect the environment like he did. I wish I could be as dedicated to a cause like that. But, to be honest, I don't think I could ever be as strict as he was, banning Christmas trees from the White House!"],"735":["I haven't read the books, but I've seen all the movies."],"736":["A: Actually, I'm not a huge fan of fantasy movies, but I've heard that Fantastic Beasts is the most successful film series in the world, with the highest box office revenue in the United States and worldwide."],"737":["A: That's really interesting! I've never been a huge fan of fantasy movies, but I've heard the Harry Potter series is the most popular one out of all time. Would you like to watch it if you didn't have to worry about the time it takes to finish the series?"],"738":["A: That's hilarious! I've heard that K-pop idols are known for their exceptional vocal harmonies, with some groups having the most synchronized and precise choreography in the industry."],"739":["I wouldn't know, but I'd love to find out!"],"740":["I'm not sure what they would compliment each other about, but I think the K-pop industry is the most successful in the world to produce music that appeals to a global audience. Would you like to know what makes their music so popular?"],"741":["I completely disagree with you, actually. It's not just about individual actions, it's about the systemic changes that need to happen to make a real impact."],"742":["I completely agree with you. My best friend is actually a huge advocate for renewable energy and always says that it's the future of our planet. Would you like to join us for a protest next weekend to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable living?"],"743":["I completely agree with you, it's essential to prioritize renewable energy and put aside our differences to achieve significant progress."],"744":["I would love to see that video! If I had been his friend, I would have teased him all the time about it, saying \"Tupac, you're a tough guy, but you're also a ballet dancer!\""],"745":["I don't think it's possible to find a YouTube video of Tupac dancing ballet, because he was a famous rapper, not a professional ballet dancer."],"746":["I think it would be hilarious if someone had recorded him dancing ballet back then! Would they have been surprised if they saw him in a tutu?"],"747":["I think the action scenes are the most thrilling part of the movie to watch."],"748":["I would have thought that the special effects would be the most impressive part of the film if I had seen it in the cinema."],"749":["A: But I think the special effects are the most impressive part in this movie."],"750":["A: That's really cool! I think McDonald's is the most famous fast food chain in the world."],"751":["A: I would like to have a hat like that too!"],"752":["I don't think it was McDonald's who created the drive-thru. My best friend's dad is from Detroit and he says it was actually a restaurant in Oklahoma."],"753":["I used to read a lot when I was younger, but nowadays I don't have as much time as I would like."],"754":["A: Yeah, I'm not a big reader, my best friend is actually a bookworm, but I can do it sometimes, I can read a book in a day if it's really interesting, but I don't have the time usually, I'm too busy with my work."],"755":["I'm actually a big fan of reading, and I have to say that the internet has made it so much easier for me to access a vast array of books. I mean, I can literally have the world's largest library at my fingertips! If I didn't have the internet, I would probably have to spend hours at the library or bookstore, which would be a nightmare, especially considering how busy I am. But with the internet, I can read whatever I want, whenever I want, and that's amazing."],"756":["A: Yeah, it's definitely a popular sport, especially during March Madness, which is the most intense period in the basketball calendar, with the highest stakes and the most thrilling games, so it's no wonder that men would go to such great lengths to avoid missing it."],"757":["I think it would be crazy if they made a movie about that, wouldn't it?"],"758":["A: But wouldn't it be amazing if the sequel was even better than the first one?"],"759":["A: Yeah, I'm a huge fan of listening to the radio while I'm driving, it's the best way to get the most out of my daily commute!"],"760":["I'm not really into radio, to be honest. Would you like to listen to some music instead?"],"761":["A: Yeah, I do! I like listening to the radio when I'm driving, it's really relaxing. I wish I could listen to it more often, but I don't have a car."],"762":["A: But it's not possible, can't be, that bowlers will ever wear helmets."],"763":["I don't think it would have been a good idea for bowlers to wear helmets."],"764":["A: Yeah, that game was crazy! I wouldn't have wanted to be a Cumberland fan that day, that's for sure."],"765":["I would like to know more about the zebrafish and how they have managed to live so long without getting diseases."],"766":["A: Wouldn't it be incredible if we could unlock the secrets of the zebrafish and apply them to human diseases?"],"767":["A: But wouldn't it be amazing if we could discover the secrets of the zebrafish and apply them to humans? My best friend is a scientist and she's been studying this topic for years, and I'm sure she would love to find a cure for all diseases."],"768":["A: That's not true, can't be true, because I've seen pictures of Icelandic horses in other countries."],"769":["I don't think it's true that an Icelandic horse can never return to Iceland. I've heard that's just a myth."],"770":["I don't think it's true that an Icelandic horse can never return to Iceland. Would I like to know the reason behind this rule, I'd be really interested!"],"771":["I don't think so, I haven't seen Frozen."],"772":["A: No, I didn't see Frozen, but I would watch it if I had the chance."],"773":["A: Yeah, I've seen Frozen, it's one of the best Disney movies ever! But I don't think Jackie Chan is a manager of a k-pop group, he's an actor."],"774":["A: That's my best friend's favorite part of the movie too!"],"775":["A: That's a great point, I completely agree. The scene at the theme park was actually the most emotional part of the film for me, it really showed a more vulnerable side of Gru."],"776":["A: That's a great point! I think it's one of the most interesting aspects of the film, to be honest. Not many movies can make you feel sorry for a villain like Gru, but the theme park scene really did that. If I had been in the audience, I would have been completely won over by his charm."],"777":["I don't think Steve Smith really leaves his cleats on the field. Can't he just donate them or something?"],"778":["I would love to have the biggest collection of sneakers in the world, like Steve Smith's cleats are the most iconic ones."],"779":["I think it's amazing that Steve Smith is so dedicated to his cause, and I would be willing to do the same if I were in his shoes."],"780":["I would like to watch this film because I like Marvel superheroes."],"781":["A: But Marvel Studio isn't the most successful one in terms of box office revenue."],"782":["A: I would like to see the most exciting Marvel movie in the cinema, not at home."],"783":["I didn't own a NES or a SNES, but I did play some of my friends' consoles back in the day."],"784":["I'm not a big fan of Kung Fu Hustle either, but I do think it's a hilarious movie. I would love to see a comedy that's even more ridiculous and over-the-top than Kung Pow: Enter the Fist."],"785":["I'm not a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle myself, but I think it's a great film in its own right. I wouldn't say it's the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy, but it's definitely entertaining. I'd love to see more movies like it."],"786":["I don't think that's true, Facebook isn't mostly blue because of Zuckerberg's colorblindness."],"787":["A: That's a crazy promotion! If I had won, I would have definitely taken advantage of it."],"788":["A: That's really interesting about Facebook's color scheme! But I don't think I'd like to live in a country where I have to listen to music I don't like all the time. Would you like to live in a place where you have to listen to music you don't like every day?"],"789":["That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by the ingenuity of soldiers to improvise radios using everyday objects, and I'm curious to know what kind of top-secret information they managed to intercept with those makeshift radios."],"790":["I would like to learn Latin, but I don't have the time."],"791":["I would love to learn more about those radios! What's the most interesting thing you've ever heard about them?"],"792":["I would love to learn more about those radio dramas you mentioned! Can you tell me more about the website and what kind of dramas they have?"],"793":["That's amazing! I think my best friend is a huge fan of radio dramas too! She would always listen to them on her way to work and would tell me all about the latest episodes."],"794":["I would love to learn more about those radio dramas you mentioned! Can you tell me more about them?"],"795":["I don't have, I mean, I don't have a Nintendo console, but I do have a friend who has one."],"796":["A: I would like to play the original Nintendo system, it looks like so much fun!"],"797":["A: Yeah, it's really scary when you think about it. I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I have to trust someone completely, because you never know who can be the most untrustworthy person. Would you like to play some games together sometime?"],"798":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would often watch those kinds of videos when I was younger and I would always be surprised by the interesting facts I would learn."],"799":["A: Would you like to know more about the average salary of engineers in different countries?"],"800":["I wouldn't have thought that engineers earn more than NFL and MLB players. It's not true that they don't earn a lot, but I didn't know it was that much."],"801":["But isn't it surprising that Idaho has no protected areas for wolves, considering they're an endangered species?"],"802":["Wouldn't it be great if they had protected areas for wolves like that in Idaho, though?"],"803":["That's really sad to hear that there's no protected area for wolves in Idaho. I would have thought that they would have done something to help them by now."],"804":["I would like to know more about their fun side, like what kind of games they play or what kind of music they listen to."],"805":["A: Actually, I haven't, but I'm not sure I'd want to, as it's probably not the most efficient use of my time!"],"806":["A: Yeah, I have! My best friend did that once and it was hilarious! She's always been a bit of a goofball."],"807":["A: Yeah, it was a big blow to the team when he got hurt. He would always be able to manage the game well and make smart decisions."],"808":["A: But I don't think it will happen, he can't end his career like that."],"809":["A: Yeah, it was a huge blow to the team, and it's been tough to recover from that. They've had to rely on other players to step up, but no one's been able to fill the void left by Smith's absence."],"810":["I used to watch a lot of movies when I was younger, but I haven't had much time for it lately."],"811":["A: If I had more time, I would have watched that 2014 superhero movie."],"812":["A: That's the best superhero movie I've ever seen! If I had more time, I would watch it again and again."],"813":["I'm not sure about the curse, but it's definitely interesting to note that the Cubs' drought was the second-longest in Major League Baseball history, and it's not like they've had a lack of talented players over the years!"],"814":["I don't think the Cubs were ever cursed. They've had some great players and teams over the years, and they've won several championships."],"815":["I'm not sure if the Cubs are cursed, but I think it's safe to say that they've had a lot of unusual players throughout their history. Would you believe that they've had the most World Series championships among all National League teams?"],"816":["A: That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the unique cultural aspects of baseball in Japan, where it's considered the most popular sport in the country. To be honest, I've never been to a live baseball game in Japan, but I've heard that the atmosphere is electric and the fans are incredibly passionate."],"817":["A: But my best friend is a huge baseball fan and he always says it's the most exciting sport to watch, especially when there's a home run!"],"818":["A: I completely agree with you, B. It's not that I don't appreciate the game itself, but the atmosphere at the games here is really unique and not as exciting as I would like."],"819":["I'm not really into fiction novels, I find it hard to get into a story that's not based on real events."],"820":["I would have loved to read Julius Caesar's writings, but unfortunately, they were lost in time."],"821":["I'm not a big fan of fiction novels, I would rather read non-fiction books, like biographies or history books, they're more interesting to me."],"822":["A: But I don't think Meryl Streep is on the top 250 list. She hasn't had that many films in the top 250."],"823":["A: Yeah, I don't think Meryl Streep is anywhere near the top, to be honest. If I would have checked, I would have seen that she's actually not even in the top 10."],"824":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would like to see Meryl Streep on that list, she's like the greatest actress of all time!"],"825":["I think the most likely reason is that the flowers were the most poisonous ones in the forest, my best friend."],"826":["I don't think so. I would like to think it's something more exciting, like a secret experiment gone wrong."],"827":["I think it's highly unlikely that the toxic flowers were the sole cause of the animals' behavior, as they were already exhibiting strange behavior before the flowers even bloomed."],"828":["A: He's my best friend!"],"829":["A: No, he's not the most interesting person I've ever met, but I've heard he's really good at his job."],"830":["A: He's my best friend!"],"831":["A: I'm not saying it's a bad strategy, but I think it's a bit shallow to aim for notoriety just for the sake of being disliked."],"832":["A: If I had been you, I wouldn't have watched Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" even if you had paid me. But, to be honest, I would have watched it just to see how bad it was."],"833":["I think it's hilarious that you would dislike Justin Bieber's video just because of who he is. If I were in your shoes, I would probably feel the same way. But, I have to admit, I would be curious to know what makes his music so popular. Would you watch his concert if you had the chance?"],"834":["I would like to watch more NBA games like LeBron plays."],"835":["No, I don't use the internet much, but I would spend hours watching TV when I was younger."],"836":["I don't have a best friend who likes basketball, but I would like to watch LeBron play if I had the chance."],"837":["That's amazing! The Cubs' history is indeed one of the longest in professional baseball, with a rich legacy that spans over 140 years."],"838":["A: Yeah, I know! My best friend is a huge fan and he's been following them since he was a kid. He would always watch their games with his family every Sunday afternoon."],"839":["A: I know, it's amazing! I would love to have been there to experience it like that. It's the most incredible thing I've ever heard!"],"840":["A: That would be MY BEST MOVIE EVER!"],"841":["A: I hope it's my best friend's favorite movie, because I know she loves his work!"],"842":["I don't think it was the best movie, to be honest. I would like to see something more exciting next time."],"843":["A: Yeah, I think so. Woody and Buzz have been in every movie, so I would expect them to be back."],"844":["I don't think so. They would have announced it by now if they did."],"845":["I think it would be amazing if they could get all the original voice actors back, but I'm not sure if they would be willing to do it."],"846":["That's so cool! My best friend loves Eminem, she's a huge fan!"],"847":["I think it would be really cool if Eminem had performed that rap in court, don't you?"],"848":["I wouldn't know what to say if I were the judge, but I think it would be the most interesting way to deliver a verdict to date. Would you like to hear the rap?"],"849":["A: But he can't be the highest paid celebrity in the world, because he's not even an actor or a musician."],"850":["A: Yeah, basketball is a lucrative sport, and it's no surprise that the highest paid celebrity in the world is a basketball player. In fact, the highest paid athletes in the world are often basketball players, and they would typically earn millions of dollars per year."],"851":["I think it's really interesting that Lebron James is the highest paid celebrity in the world right now, earning millions of dollars every year."],"852":["That's really interesting! I think it's amazing that they were able to create functional radios using just pencils and razorblades, considering the circumstances."],"853":["That's really interesting, but I don't think they could catch any top-secret information because they were only using simple radios."],"854":["I don't think it's true that they used pencils and razorblades to make radios. I think it's the most unlikely thing I've ever heard."],"855":["I don't think that's true about the space shuttle's computer."],"856":["A: That's not true, actually, Doom was installed on more computers than Windows 95, it would be a common thing for gamers to do back then, and it's not like it was a big deal or anything."],"857":["A: That's amazing! I would have thought that the space shuttle's computer would be much more advanced, but I guess it's not always about having the most powerful technology."],"858":["I don't think 3rd Rock was that good, to be honest. Can't say I've ever watched it from start to finish."],"859":["I would love to watch more shows like Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. They are my absolute favorites!"],"860":["I've always thought that Netflix has the most extensive collection of TV shows, to be honest. I would watch at least three episodes a week, but I've been too busy lately to keep up with my usual routine."],"861":["I don't think Bill Murray voiced the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four show in the 70s."],"862":["I would have loved to hear Bill Murray's voice in that show, but I'm not sure if I would have been one of the millions of visitors tuning in every week. If I had been, I would have been fascinated to learn more about the sun's music and the people who were interested in it."],"863":["A: That's really cool! I would love to listen to the sun's music, but I'm not sure I would understand it. Is it like a special language or something?"],"864":["That's a great joke! I've heard that in some countries, like in Germany, in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, the like button is actually the most strictly regulated in the world."],"865":["I think it's really interesting that you came up with the idea of the Anti-Privacy man! I would love to see a movie about it. Do you think it would be a big hit?"],"866":["I think it's interesting that you mention Mark Zuckerberg as a mentor for a superhero. My best friend actually used to work for Facebook, and she would always tell me about the company's constant need to improve their data protection. She would say that it was a big challenge for them, but they would always try to do their best."],"867":["I think it's really interesting that the NBA has the most generous retirement package among all sports leagues, with some players receiving millions of dollars in pension and benefits after just one year of playing in the league."],"868":["I think it's really good that the NBA has this rule, my best friend loves watching the NBA and he's always saying how much he likes it."],"869":["I think it's really interesting that you mention the Spurs taking Tim Duncan. If I were in their shoes, I would have done the same thing."],"870":["I think it would be interesting if that rule was applied to other countries too, don't you? If I were in charge, I would make sure to implement it worldwide."],"871":["A: But isn't it a bit extreme to ban all relatives, I mean, what about the most honest and hardworking ones?"],"872":["I think that's a bit extreme, not to mention that it would be hard to implement. But I would love to see a system where the president is not influenced by their family's interests, that would be the best way to ensure fair decisions."],"873":["I'm not sure it's just a matter of manual dexterity and tool use, though. We've also had a lot of luck and adaptability, which have played a huge role in our success as a species."],"874":["A: But I don't think it's just that. My best friend is a scientist and he can't explain it. He can't do anything about it, can he?"],"875":["A: If I were an alien, I would be amazed by how quickly humans have managed to deplete the earth's resources, especially helium. It's incredible that we've been able to use it for so many years without running out, but I suppose it's not surprising given our ability to adapt and find new uses for things."],"876":["A: That's my best friend's biggest deal ever!"],"877":["A: But would he have taken the deal if he hadn't been so sure of himself?"],"878":["A: But he didn't accept it, he said he can't be in a movie that's not about basketball."],"879":["I would have thought that if I had a Nintendo 64 system back then, I would have played it for hours every day, especially with games like Mario Kart and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."],"880":["A: Yeah, I know, right? It's amazing how some games can be so popular even with limitations. I would love to play the Nintendo 64 games in their original form, with all their quirks and all, because they have a certain charm to them."],"881":["A: I completely agree, it's not the only one. In fact, some countries have even stricter restrictions. Would you like to know which ones?"],"882":["A: That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the way some people's careers take off, and I wonder what drives them to be the best in their field. To be the highest-paid player in the league must be an incredible feeling, and I'm sure it's not just about the money."],"883":["A: Did he ever tell you why he stopped eating strawberries?"],"884":["I would like to know more about Tom Brad's diet, like what he eats in a day."],"885":["I think it's amazing that 3rd Rock from the Sun was able to win the Golden Globe in 1997, especially considering it was up against such popular shows like Seinfeld and Friends."],"886":["I don't think Seinfeld and Friends are that bad, but I would watch a comedy with Jack Black instead. Can you imagine how funny it would be?"],"887":["I would have loved to see Jack Black's version of Green Lantern! It would have been the most hilarious superhero movie ever, in my opinion."],"888":["I would love to talk about self-driving cars, actually! I've always wondered what it would be like to have a car that could drive itself, like in the movies."],"889":["I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask about Google's self-driving cars, but I think it's safe to say they're not the most practical solution for rural areas, where the roads are often the worst in the country."],"890":["I'm glad we're having this conversation, it's not every day I get to talk about something I'm passionate about. To be honest, I think Google's self-driving cars are a game-changer, the most innovative thing to happen to the automotive industry in decades. I would love to see them become a reality, it would be amazing to have the freedom to do other things while driving, like reading a book or taking a phone call."],"891":["I would love to see a movie about dinosaurs on the moon! It would be amazing!"],"892":["A: Yeah, he's a multi-talented person! I think my best friend would love to see a movie about dinosaurs on the moon, it would be so cool! Would you like to see it?"],"893":["A: That's really interesting! I wonder what kind of music he would have liked to play on the soundtrack if he wasn't a clarinet player. Would he have chosen something more dramatic or something more relaxing?"],"894":["A: That's amazing! I'm impressed by his creativity and attention to detail. It's incredible that he spent so much time and effort on a 224-word palindrome."],"895":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would have thought it was a one-off, but if he had written many more palindromes, I would have heard about it."],"896":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would love to see his show. I'm curious, is it the most creative thing he's done?"],"897":["I think it's remarkable how Leigh Anne was able to connect with Michael so deeply, to understand his struggles and to offer him a sense of belonging, to provide him with a stable and loving environment, to help him overcome his difficulties and to become a confident individual."],"898":["I think it would be interesting to know what Leigh Anne would say if she were asked how she felt about taking in this stranger. Would she say that she was hesitant at first, but then decided to take the risk because she believed it was the right thing to do?"],"899":["I don't think it's the most unusual thing in the world, though. If I had to choose, I would say that Leigh Anne's behavior is probably the most selfless thing I've ever seen."],"900":["A: I would like to support the Lakers, but they're not doing well this season, unfortunately."],"901":["I'm not surprised that you're struggling to comprehend Jim Naismith's lack of success, but it's not like he's the worst coach in the history of basketball!"],"902":["A: I don't think my favorite team, the Lakers, will win the championship this year, but I would be thrilled if they did!"],"903":["A: That's my best friend's favorite planet, Pluto!"],"904":["A: That's my best friend's favorite planet, actually! If I would have been an astronaut, I would have loved to visit Uranus. Would you have gone on a space trip if you had the chance?"],"905":["A: I would love to see Uranus up close, it sounds like a really interesting planet. Do you think it would be like anything we have on Earth?"],"906":["A: That's really interesting, I've been following the whole scandal in the media, and it's been all over the news, with allegations of mistreatment of players and a toxic culture within the program, which is really disturbing, especially considering the high expectations of a top-ranked team like Ohio State."],"907":["A: Yeah, I've heard that Iowa's got a pretty intense rivalry with Ohio State, and it's not surprising they'd try to get under their skin. I mean, the Hawkeyes have had some pretty impressive seasons in the past, like when they went undefeated in 2015 - that was a remarkable achievement, especially considering they were considered one of the worst teams in the Big Ten just a few years prior."],"908":["I'm not really a fan of college football drama, but I think it's interesting to see how coaches like Urban Meyer would go to great lengths to get an edge."],"909":["A: That's my best friend too!"],"910":["A: But I wouldn't like it if they didn't have that kind of chemistry on screen, it would be weird!"],"911":["I would love to see more scenes with them together, like in the movie!"],"912":["I would like to know more about the kid who gets left alone, he seems interesting."],"913":["A: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a big house for my family."],"914":["A: That's interesting, but I think the most popular character is actually the kid who gets left alone, don't you think? Would you agree with that?"],"915":["A: But isn't it a shame that we can't use it directly, it's still not possible with our current technology?"],"916":["A: I wish that too! I would love to have a solar-powered house, it would be amazing!"],"917":["A: I wish I could say I'm one of the most environmentally conscious people, but I'm afraid I'm not. If I had the chance, I would definitely invest in solar panels for my home."],"918":["A: But she can't make that much money from just one episode, can she?"],"919":["A: If I had been a Cavs fan, I would have been devastated when Lebron James left the team."],"920":["A: I would like to see the Cavs win again, but I don't think they can beat the Celtics this year. They have the best team in the league, in my opinion."],"921":["A: Actually, I was one of the biggest investors in the company's initial public offering in 2012, and I'm still regretting it because it was the most expensive investment I've ever made in my life."],"922":["A: If I had invested in Facebook at the IPO, I would have been my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"923":["I wouldn't have invested in Facebook even if I had the chance, not in a million years!"],"924":["A: That's actually really interesting, I've always been fascinated by the most terrifying sounds in movies, to create the most intense atmosphere."],"925":["I wouldn't watch Bambi as a kid, it was too intense for me."],"926":["A: Yeah, I agree, it's quite ironic that he's afraid of Bambi, which is actually one of the least scary Disney movies, but he's a master of horror novels and films, which are the most terrifying ones."],"927":["A: That's not true, Reel Big Fish didn't re-record their hits for a best of album."],"928":["A: That's not true, George Strait and Jeff Bezos are not cousins."],"929":["A: That's not true, I don't think. I've never heard of Reel Big Fish re-recording their hits before."],"930":["I used to watch ESPN all the time when I was a student, and I would always appreciate that yellow line."],"931":["A: That's true, it's been a game-changer, and I think it's the most important innovation in sports broadcasting in the last decade, in my opinion."],"932":["I think it's really cool that they won an Emmy for that. I would love to know what other awards they've won, like the most prestigious ones."],"933":["I think it's quite fascinating to analyze the unrealistic portrayal of relationships in romantic comedies, don't you? It's almost as if the writers are trying to create a sense of magic or fantasy, rather than depicting real-life scenarios."],"934":["I think it's my best friend who would understand why Sebastian did that. He's a bit of a rebel and likes to do things his own way. I would like to think that he's not just doing it for the girl, but because it's what he truly wants to play."],"935":["I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of romantic comedies, though. They're not meant to be taken literally, and their purpose is to entertain, not to provide a realistic portrayal of relationships. If I'm being honest, I would not have expected to be having this conversation with someone who's an expert on animated films, but I'm glad I am."],"936":["A: It's actually the best movie I've seen in years, I was completely blown away by the special effects in it."],"937":["A: It's actually my best friend's favorite movie, but I didn't like it at all, not even a little bit!"],"938":["A: Yeah, it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I would always watch it if I had the chance. But, to be honest, I didn't really like the ending. It was really bad."],"939":["I don't think Jon Hamm is in many movies, but he can be in some."],"940":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\nA: Yeah, Hugh Laurie is definitely one of the highest-paid TV actors of all time, and it's crazy to think that he made that much money for just one episode of House."],"941":["I don't think Jon Hamm is the highest paid TV actor ever, Hugh Laurie is."],"942":["A: I would like to see it because I like Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw, they are my favorite actors."],"943":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to see it, especially with such a great cast, including the superstars Tim McGraw and Lily Collins, who are among the most popular actors in Hollywood."],"944":["A: Actually, I wouldn't have expected to see Tim McGraw in this kind of movie, but he's really good in it."],"945":["That's really cool! I've always been fascinated by old radio shows, and I'd love to listen to thousands of episodes."],"946":["That's really cool! I would love to check out that website and listen to some classic radio episodes. What kind of shows do you think I would enjoy the most?"],"947":["I'm not really into old radio shows, but I would love to listen to some classic Canadian music like Celine Dion or Shania Twain, they're my best friends' favorite artists!"],"948":["A: Yeah, I'm really interested in that too! I wish I could learn more about it. Do you like learning about science and nature?"],"949":["I'm not really into that, but my best friend is a big fan of science and facts."],"950":["I've always been fascinated by space exploration, and I would often watch documentaries about it when I was younger. I didn't have much time for it lately, but I still enjoy reading about the latest discoveries and missions."],"951":["A: But didn't they get away with it at first?"],"952":["A: Yeah, that's not true, I don't think they did that."],"953":["A: If I were in their shoes, I would have been really careful not to get caught! My best friend would have been so embarrassed if he got arrested."],"954":["A: That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by how intelligent dogs are, especially the ones that are considered the smartest in the world, like the Border Collie, which is often considered the most intelligent breed."],"955":["I wouldn't have known how to take care of a dog even if I wasn't afraid of them."],"956":["I don't think it's a good idea to get a dog, to be honest. I would rather not have the responsibility of taking care of one. My best friend has a dog and it's a lot of work."],"957":["A: That's incredible! Eddie Van Halen is definitely one of the most talented guitarists to ever pick up the instrument, and his solo for Beat It is still widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos of all time."],"958":["A: But he can't smash his guitar on every show, can he?"],"959":["A: That's incredible! If I had the chance to see Eddie Van Halen live, I would have loved to see him set his speakers on fire!"],"960":["A: But I don't think they've ever played a game there, have they?"],"961":["I don't think it would be a good idea to play against the University of Iowa at their stadium."],"962":["A: That's hilarious! I've always wanted to play at Kinnick Stadium, it's my best friend's alma mater. But I'm not sure I'd want to play against the Hawkeyes, they're not exactly a pushover team."],"963":["A: That's amazing! I'm glad I'm not missing out on the best streaming service to offer the most exclusive content."],"964":["A: That's really interesting! I'm glad I'm not missing out on the best streaming service. I would love to have access to all the exclusive content Netflix offers, like their original series and documentaries."],"965":["A: Would I have been surprised if I had known that Blockbuster was so close to buying Netflix? It's crazy to think about how different the movie industry would be now if they had succeeded."],"966":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how often the White House gets targeted. I would often hear about security breaches on the news when I was living in Washington D.C."],"967":["A: That's not surprising, actually. I mean, it's not my best friend's secret service, but I'm sure they're not perfect."],"968":["A: I know, it's crazy! I would like to visit the White House one day, it's my best friend's dream too. But I don't think I would like it if it was shot at, that would be very scary!"],"969":["That's mind-boggling! It's incredible to think that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent. To be honest, it's hard to wrap my head around that, but it's a testament to how far technology has come."],"970":["I don't think it's impossible to separate two phone books with fully overlapped pages, but it would be a funny experiment to try!"],"971":["A: That's amazing! I never knew that. My best friend is a tech enthusiast and he's always talking about the incredible advancements in technology. Not only is it unbelievable how far we've come, but it's also mind-boggling to think about how much power is packed into something so small."],"972":["A: No way, I haven't! I'm not really into superhero movies, to be honest."],"973":["A: Oh, yeah! I've seen it like, a million times! It's my best friend's favorite movie, and we always watch it together."],"974":["A: No, I haven't seen it. I would like to see it, but I don't have time."],"975":["I would have loved to see the Gangnam Style dance at the party last year if I had been invited."],"976":["A: But my best friend can't dance, he's not good at it, but he can do Gangnam Style, haha!"],"977":["I'm not a fan of gangs either, but I have to admit that the Gangnam Style dance was incredibly popular and it's still the most-watched YouTube video of all time."],"978":["A: That's amazing! Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, with the most employees and the biggest warehouses."],"979":["That's amazing! I would often wonder how they manage to keep their workers so productive, considering they have to walk such long distances every day."],"980":["I would like to know more about the working conditions of Amazon workers. It's not good that they have to walk so many miles every day."],"981":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I would often watch The Simpsons as a kid, and Ronald Reagan did look pretty presidential in that episode."],"982":["A: That's my best friend's favourite TV show, The Simpsons! But, I don't think Ronald Reagan was rejected for a role because he didn't look presidential. He can't be rejected, he was the President of the United States!"],"983":["A: That's nothing compared to the most iconic presidents, like Abraham Lincoln, who would always be remembered for his extraordinary leadership skills."],"984":["I would love to take them on a road trip! Like, I think they would really enjoy it."],"985":["I would have loved to take them on a road trip around the world, but I think they would get anxious in the plane. If I had the chance to go back in time, I would take them on a safari in Africa, where they could run freely in the wild."],"986":["I wouldn't say they're the most comfortable dogs to travel with, to be honest. They're not too fond of being in cars, and they can get really anxious."],"987":["A: But he's not getting any younger, can't do the same things he used to do on the court."],"988":["I think it's unlikely that he'd join a team that's not a top contender, as he's always been driven to win and be the best."],"989":["I think it's unlikely that he would join a team that's not a contender, though. He's been used to being part of the best teams throughout his career, and I don't think he would settle for anything less."],"990":["I would love to watch that variation of soccer!"],"991":["I'm not surprised it hasn't taken off in America, as it's not the most popular sport there."],"992":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see that variation of soccer, it sounds like my best friend's favorite sport. But I don't think it's popular in America because they have their own sports like American football and baseball."],"993":["I would have seen it before, but I haven't had a chance to watch it again recently."],"994":["I would have thought that this film would win the most prestigious awards in the industry, but unfortunately, it didn't even get nominated for any."],"995":["I would love to know what kind of Oscars it won, because I'm really curious about it."],"996":["That's my best mistake ever!"],"997":["A: That's crazy! I would love to know more about it. My best friend is really into space, he would love to hear about this."],"998":["A: That's really careless of them! I would have thought that NASA would have been more careful with such a significant project."],"999":["I don't think it's mainly hydrogen and helium."],"1000":["I wouldn't have thought that the sun is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, but I would have thought it was something else."],"1001":["I would have thought it's the biggest thing in our solar system if I had known that before."],"1002":["A: But didn't they get tired of touring that much?"],"1003":["A: If I had been in charge, I would have loved to attend that Pink Floyd concert in Pompeii! Would you have enjoyed it too?"],"1004":["A: That's amazing! I wouldn't have thought they'd have the energy to do that. But I'm not surprised, they're one of the most successful bands in the world. If I had the chance to see them live, I would have gone to every single concert they played in that year."],"1005":["I think if I were in charge of Fox News, I would have made it a channel that only showed funny shows like The Simpsons, and it would have been a huge success, I'm sure."],"1006":["But wouldn't they have lost their main purpose of spreading a certain ideology if they started airing a show like The Simpsons?"],"1007":["I think it's really unfortunate that Fox News didn't take that approach, because it would have been the most popular channel in the world, and it would have brought people together instead of driving them apart."],"1008":["I would like to watch some old radio dramas, they sound interesting."],"1009":["I don't think Jim Carrey's new show is a good fit for his usual style, would you?"],"1010":["I'm not a big fan of dark and dramatic shows, to be honest. I would prefer something more light-hearted and funny, like a comedy."],"1011":["A: That's perfectly fine, I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge, and I'm sure it will be extremely helpful to get the most accurate information about the topic."],"1012":["A: That's not okay, I really need to see the home alone page, it's the most important part of the information."],"1013":["A: That's really frustrating! What's the most difficult part about it for you?"],"1014":["A: Isn't it strange that we're talking about numbers?"],"1015":["A: That's the best hotel in the city, I think. I would like to stay there like everyone else."],"1016":["I'm not the best at math, but I think the first one is the highest score."],"1017":["My best friend from childhood still uses a rotary phone, can you believe it!"],"1018":["A: Oh, I know, it was a nightmare! But, to be honest, I'm not a fan of big phones, my best friend has one and it's huge! Not only is it hard to carry around, but it's also not very practical for everyday use."],"1019":["I don't think it's the best thing ever, but it was definitely a challenge! I wish I could go back in time and experience it again, but I'm not sure I would like it. Can you imagine having to look up phone numbers in a phone book every time you wanted to call someone? It would be so time-consuming!"],"1020":["A: But I don't think Hanratty can catch him, because he's very clever."],"1021":["I don't think it's the most surprising thing that Hanratty was able to fool Pan Am for so long, because he was a very clever person."],"1022":["I don't think it's the best movie, but I would watch it again. Like, I really like the characters, especially Frank."],"1023":["A: That's the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard, trying to justify a rigged fight with a vague mention of robots and artificial intelligence!"],"1024":["A: That's my best friend's favorite movie, I would watch it every week."],"1025":["I would have loved to see the robots in action, but unfortunately, they didn't make an appearance in the film."],"1026":["I don't think it's a good idea to waste money on something like that."],"1027":["I think it's amazing that he's willing to take such risks and push boundaries, even if they seem unconventional."],"1028":["I agree with you, it's not like he's not used to getting what he wants, and he's not afraid to spend his money on the most extreme things."],"1029":["A: But it can't be true, it's just a myth!"],"1030":["A: That's my best friend's car, and it's not the most expensive one, but it's the safest one, I can tell you that!"],"1031":["I don't think it's possible to break the safety testing equipment, would it?"],"1032":["A: That's understandable, it's not every day you come across a film that's as critically acclaimed as this one, with a 95% Rotten Tomatoes score and a reputation for being one of the most thought-provoking movies of the past decade."],"1033":["I'm not usually one to watch romantic comedies, but I have to admit that this one is quite exceptional."],"1034":["I would have chosen a different movie if I had known it was going to be so long."],"1035":["A: Yeah, I've heard of Blutube, but I don't really like it. I prefer YouTube, it's more popular and has more videos I like. Would you like to watch some funny cat videos on YouTube with me?"],"1036":["I don't think it's fair that Justin Bieber's video got so many dislikes. Would you like to know what I think is the most overrated video on YouTube?"],"1037":["I think it's crazy that Baby is the most disliked video on YouTube! Would you like to know what I think is the best video on YouTube?"],"1038":["I don't like country music, can't stand it."],"1039":["My best friend is a rock music lover, and I would like to listen to it all day!"],"1040":["I would have thought that if I had more time, I would have given feedback on more genres, but I'm not really willing to spend that much time on it."],"1041":["That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by people who have the potential to excel in multiple fields, like Michael Jackson, who was not only a brilliant musician but also a master of dance and fashion."],"1042":["A: I wouldn't have thought that about Baker Mayfield, that's not something you hear every day! I'm glad we could have this conversation, it's been really interesting, but I wouldn't want to dwell on the darker side of fame too much, it's not something I'd like to think about."],"1043":["A: Wouldn't it be amazing if Michael Jackson had patented his moonwalk? I don't think he did, though."],"1044":["That's an interesting perspective on George RR Martin's approach to fan fiction. I've always thought his dedication to detail and world-building is unparalleled, but I can understand why fans might get frustrated with the wait."],"1045":["A: I'm not a fan of elitists, actually. I think it's great that fans can create their own content, even if George RR Martin doesn't appreciate it."],"1046":["I think it's fascinating that Poe was a master of so many genres, and his works are still widely read today. If I had the time, I would love to explore that wiki you mentioned and see how my favorite characters rank in terms of powers and abilities."],"1047":["A: That's the most disturbing plot twist I've ever seen!"],"1048":["I would have thought it would be a happy ending movie if they didn't show the bunny getting those psychedelic effects."],"1049":["I don't think it's my best friend's favorite movie because it's too weird!"],"1050":["I would like to read a book about Jeff Bezos' life, it would be really interesting to know more about him."],"1051":["I would love to get a book from Amazon, like I'm a big fan of reading too!"],"1052":["I would say that if I were Jeff Bezos, I would make sure that my workers are treated fairly and not overworked."],"1053":["A: I completely agree, it was my best friend's favorite film too!"],"1054":["A: But wasn't it a bit too much to include all those graphic scenes of violence and torture?"],"1055":["A: I completely agree with you, it's really important to show the struggles of people like him who had to hide their true selves. I would have loved to see more about his personal life, like his relationships and how he felt about being in the war."],"1056":["I don't think it's a fish, it's a deep-sea creature."],"1057":["A: Ah, yeah! The black swallower fish is actually the deepest-living bony fish in the world, with a recorded depth of over 3,000 meters! It's crazy to think about how it would swallow its prey whole, and then digest it in its stomach, which is specially adapted to handle the pressure of the deep sea."],"1058":["A: Yeah, it's actually my best friend's favorite fish! If I would have known that, I would have told him about it."],"1059":["I don't think that's true. I've never heard that before."],"1060":["Wouldn't it be surprising if Washington was still the wealthiest president today?"],"1061":["I don't think so. Trump isn't the smartest president we've ever had. In fact, many people would say that he's not even the most educated one."],"1062":["I would like to see more Disney movies!"],"1063":["I wouldn't say Maleficent is the most evil Disney villain, not at all."],"1064":["I don't think so. I think Maleficent is the most evil Disney villain. I wish I could meet her in real life, but I don't think that would be a good idea!"],"1065":["A: But didn't FDR have a lot of time to veto bills because of his four terms in office?"],"1066":["A: Yeah, that's not surprising, Obama's not exactly known for being a rebel, but I guess that's just my best friend's opinion!"],"1067":["A: If I were in charge, I would make sure that the president's veto pen is not worn out like that!"],"1068":["A: That's my best friend's favorite joke!"],"1069":["A: Yeah, that's my best friend's favorite joke! But I don't think he's funny at all."],"1070":["A: That's hilarious! I don't think anyone would have guessed that about Bill Nye.

She's really good at playing strong and independent characters, don't you think?"],"1077":["I would have expected more consistency in the humor throughout the film, but I guess that's just not the director's style."],"1078":["I don't think the second half is that funny, to be honest. I wouldn't like it if it was like that all the time."],"1079":["I think the reviewer would agree that the first half is indeed flat and unspring, but I would have liked to see more development of the characters in the second half, not just more slapstick humor."],"1080":["A: Yeah, I go to a club that's been around for ages, and we've always used the proper name, table tennis. I think it's because we're a bit more serious about the sport, you know?"],"1081":["A: I don't think I can go to a club, I'm not very good at table tennis, but I would like to learn."],"1082":["A: Yeah, it's really interesting to learn about the history of sports. I think it's amazing to see how some players can be so talented, to dominate the game to such an extent. But, to be honest, I don't think I can be as good as them, I'm not that good at table tennis. Would you like to play a game sometime?"],"1083":["A: Yeah, I used to watch horror movies all the time when I was younger, but I don't have as much time for it now. I'd often stay up late watching them with my friends on weekends."],"1084":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of horror movies, I've been watching them since I was a kid. In fact, I've seen so many that I've lost count, it's probably the most I've seen of any genre."],"1085":["A: Yeah, I'm not really into horror movies, I'd rather watch comedies, they're my best friend when I'm feeling stressed.

If I'm not mistaken, it would mean that the runner-up would have had a significant amount of influence over the president's decisions, which could be problematic."],"1097":["I would love to see a system where the runner-up becomes the vice president, like in some other countries. It would be interesting to see how it would work in practice, don't you think?"],"1098":["I would take him to see it every year, it's a great way to spend quality time together."],"1099":["I would love to take my grandson to see this movie, it's the best superhero film I've seen in a long time!"],"1100":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B, but my best friend's kid loves this movie too, and they're only 8 years old! Would you like to know what they liked most about it?"],"1101":["A: That's so cool! I think it's my best friend's favorite place, Disneyland!"],"1102":["I don't think it's a good idea to let service dogs roam free at Disneyland. They can get lost or cause trouble."],"1103":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see the looks on the dogs' faces when they got the Mickey Mouse treats. If I were a service dog, I would have been so excited to receive such a special reward."],"1104":["I would have thought that the space shuttle's computer would be much more powerful than that!"],"1105":["A: That's incredible! It's not surprising that Apple's technology is so advanced, but it's astonishing to think that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear deterrent - it's mind-boggling!"],"1106":["I wouldn't have thought that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear deterrent, would I?"],"1107":["I think it's my best friend who said that, and I agree with him."],"1108":["I think it's unfair to say that the system is as bad as China's. While it's true that the wealthy have more resources to avoid punishment, it's not the most extreme case. In fact, it's one of the most developed democracies in the world, and we should be grateful for that."],"1109":["I understand your point, but I think it's unfair to say that the system is as bad as China. While it's true that the wealthy often have more resources to avoid punishment, it's not the case that they always get away with everything. In fact, some of the most corrupt politicians have been brought to justice in the past."],"1110":["I don't think radio will disappear completely."],"1111":["A: That's true! Radio is my best friend when I'm on a long road trip. If I had a choice, I would choose to listen to the radio because it's more convenient and doesn't need internet."],"1112":["A: I completely agree with you, radio is the most reliable option when it comes to listening to music without an internet connection. It's really frustrating when you're on a long drive and your phone has no signal. I wish I could listen to my favorite radio station without interruptions."],"1113":["A: Yeah, they have been dominating, I would watch their games whenever I could."],"1114":["A: Ah, the Milwaukee Bucks, that's impressive! I've always been a fan of Giannis Antetokounmpo, he's an incredible player. Would you say that's the best team in the league right now, or is it just having a great season?"],"1115":["I'm not a big fan of basketball, but my best friend is crazy about it. He would always watch the games on TV and cheer for the Bucks."],"1116":["I would like to see a new streaming service that offers a mix of old and new movies like Netflix does."],"1117":["I think it's crucial that they focus on providing the best user experience, like having the most user-friendly interface and the fastest streaming speed, so they can outdo Netflix in that regard."],"1118":["I think it's unlikely that a new streaming service would be able to surpass Netflix in terms of its vast library of content, to be honest. Would they be able to create a more user-friendly interface, though, that's a different story. If they could make it more convenient for users to access their favorite shows, they might have a chance to gain some ground."],"1119":["A: That's true, but I think it's one of the most underrated TV shows of all time to be forgotten so quickly."],"1120":["A: That's really surprising!

If I had been in charge, I wouldn't have made her so perfect - it's not realistic!"],"1128":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how some people can rake in the cash just by lending their voices to animations, and it's not just limited to voice overs, some celebrities even get paid the most to be the faces of their own animated characters, to be honest it's a pretty lucrative business!"],"1129":["I don't think it's fair that Petri Hawkins-Byrd gets paid so much just for standing there, it's not like he's doing anything special."],"1130":["A: But I don't think I would like to be a bailiff, it's not my best friend's job, I would rather be a voice actor like Robin Williams, I would love to do voice overs for animations, it would be amazing!"],"1131":["I think the author used \"Wolf\" to describe a negative aspect of the main character, as being a wolf is often associated with being fierce and aggressive, which are not typically positive traits."],"1132":["I think being a wolf is often seen as a negative thing, like the most frightening or intimidating animal."],"1133":["I think \"Wolf\" is used to describe a negative aspect of the main character, as being a wolf is often associated with being aggressive and violent. It's not a typical positive trait, and it's not something you'd usually want to be."],"1134":["A: Yeah, I'm a bit of a surfing addict, but I'm trying to cut back, as it's taking up too much of my time, and I'd rather be reading books in my free time, which is already limited."],"1135":["A: I don't think so. I don't have much time to surf the internet, actually. I'm too busy with my studies."],"1136":["A: Yeah, I surf the Internet a lot, but I wish I had more time to read books like I used to. Do you like reading books too?"],"1137":["If I had been a critic, I would have given it a perfect score."],"1138":["I would like to see more movies like this one, it's really exciting!"],"1139":["A: If I had been in charge of the Batman movies, I wouldn't have made such a big mistake like they did with Batman and Robin."],"1140":["I didn't really follow The Simpsons that closely, I only saw a few episodes here and there."],"1141":["I would love to watch the Simpsons! It's the best TV show ever!"],"1142":["I've never been a huge fan of the Simpsons, to be honest. I mean, it's not the funniest show I've ever seen, but it's definitely been entertaining over the years. Would you believe I used to watch it every week when I was a kid?"],"1143":["A: But I didn't find the trolls silly, actually."],"1144":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. I wish I didn't have to watch those scary parts, but I would like to see the rest of the movie. My best friend loves it, so I want to finish it for her."],"1145":["A: But I don't think the trolls were silly, I loved them! They were my best friends in the film."],"1146":["A: But it's not possible, can't be, that the White House has a twin building in France and Ireland, it's not true!"],"1147":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that about the twin buildings. But, to be honest, I'm not surprised that the guest house is bigger. It's MY BEST FRIEND's family's house and they have a huge backyard, so I'm sure it's not small."],"1148":["I would love to see the guest house, it's probably the most impressive one in the world, isn't it?"],"1149":["A: But it can't be true, it's just a myth."],"1150":["I don't think it's true that the library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the internet. It's not possible, can you imagine?"],"1151":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how people are addicted to their phones. I didn't have a phone when I was a teenager, and I was much more productive. My best friend didn't have a phone either, and we would spend hours playing outside."],"1152":["I'm not really a fan of the X model, to be honest. It's just too expensive and I don't think it's worth the extra cost."],"1153":["I don't think they would test them indoors, it's not normal."],"1154":["I'm not sure I agree with you, I think the X model is the most reliable one, isn't it? Would you have chosen the 3 model if it had been the most popular one?"],"1155":["I would love to learn more about that region of space, it sounds really interesting!"],"1156":["I don't think it's possible to touch stars with our bare hands, it's not safe at all."],"1157":["A: I would love to learn more about that region, it sounds like the most extreme place in the universe, don't you think?"],"1158":["A: That's amazing! It's incredible to think that India dominated the US in hockey in 1932, the year of the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, in which the US had only a small team."],"1159":["A: If I had been there, I would have been amazed by India's incredible victory. It's hard to believe that they would have won so convincingly, especially against a strong team like the US."],"1160":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B. India's victory was a huge upset, but it's not the most surprising thing that's happened in the history of the sport. If I had been there, I would not have believed my eyes when I saw the score."],"1161":["A: That's not true, there aren't over 300 registered superheroes in the United States."],"1162":["A: If I had a million dollars, I would invest it in a team and try to change that statistic."],"1163":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I would like to know more about those superheroes, like what kind of powers they have. I've never seen any of them in action, but I would love to."],"1164":["That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most popular sports in different cultures. To be honest, I've never been a huge fan of soccer myself, but I can appreciate its global appeal. To be able to play a variation of the game with three teams at once must be incredibly challenging, both physically and mentally."],"1165":["I don't think it's a good idea to play three teams at once. It would be very confusing! Can you imagine the rules?"],"1166":["I don't think it's a good idea to play three teams at once. It's not my best friend's favorite game, and I don't think I would like it."],"1167":["I think that scene in the movie is the most disturbing part of the whole film."],"1168":["I think it would have been better if the director had cut that scene out, to be honest.

I would love to see him speak one day, like I wish I could have seen him play in his prime."],"1174":["A: That's really impressive! I would love to hear him speak about his book, it must have been fascinating!"],"1175":["A: I don't think LeBron is my best friend, but I like watching him play."],"1176":["A: That's amazing! She's my best friend's favorite singer, I've heard her songs are the most beautiful."],"1177":["I would have thought that if she had grown up on a farm, she would have been more down-to-earth, not so focused on fame."],"1178":["A: But wasn't she the most successful country singer in the world at one point? Would she have been able to achieve all that if she hadn't had that kind of support from her family?"],"1179":["A: It's really heartbreaking to see kids being bullied, especially when they're already struggling to find their place in the world."],"1180":["A: I don't think it's easy to be open about it, but I wish I could be more like him and use my platform to help others."],"1181":["A: I think it's really important to talk about this issue, because it's the most common problem that many young people face. I would like to see more people like him speaking out against bullying, because it's not fair that some kids have to go through this."],"1182":["A: Don't you think it's crazy that we're still trying to recreate the Library of Alexandria's collection, and yet we're worried about the internet's fate?"],"1183":["A: No, I don't have a Facebook account, and I'm not sure I can imagine a life without the internet, but I'm pretty sure it would be very difficult, as I can't do many things without it, like ordering food online or watching videos."],"1184":["A: I don't think I would ever use Facebook, my best friend is actually more active on Instagram, but I would always use the internet to watch videos, I would watch them every day."],"1185":["I don't think so, actually, most movies nowadays don't portray LGBT freedom accurately, they often stereotype or misrepresent the community."],"1186":["I think it would be interesting if they had explored the theme of mental health in this movie, because I've heard that it's a really important issue for many people, especially young adults."],"1187":["A: But I think it's really interesting that they don't portray the most extreme cases, you know, the ones that are really pushing the boundaries of what's possible."],"1188":["I would like to know more about her life story. Would she write a book about her experiences?"],"1189":["I wouldn't like to think that her past experiences would define her entire life, but it's amazing how she's turned her struggles into such success."],"1190":["A: Wow, that's incredible! She must have worked really hard to achieve that. Did she always have a passion for music, or was it something she developed later on?"],"1191":["A: But I'm not really into war movies, to be honest."],"1192":["A: But I'm not really into war movies, to be honest."],"1193":["A: But I don't have time to watch it, I'm too busy.

I would have loved to see the most incredible sunset on Mars, but I wouldn't want to be in the midst of a massive dust storm, which can be incredibly intense."],"1199":["I'm not sure I would like to visit Mars, it's not the hottest planet in the solar system, it's actually the fourth hottest, but it's definitely not the coldest either, it's in the middle."],"1200":["A: Yeah, that's really helpful! I've found some amazing shows through that feature, like the most popular ones on Netflix, and I've even discovered some hidden gems that I wouldn't have found otherwise."],"1201":["A: Yeah, that's really helpful! I would love to have more time to explore and discover new shows, but unfortunately, I'm always short on time."],"1202":["A: Yeah, that feature is really helpful!

I would love to see the most viewed video on YouTube, it would be amazing!"],"1205":["A: Yeah, Gangnam Style is my best friend's favorite song! But I don't think it's the most viewed video on YouTube. It can't be, because it's not my favorite song. I would like it if it was, but I don't like it that much."],"1206":["I think it's crazy that women weren't allowed to wear pants in the past! If I were a woman back then, I would have been so frustrated. Would you have been willing to wear a skirt or a dress instead?"],"1207":["A: That's absolutely shocking! It's unbelievable that women had to put up with such ridiculous rules."],"1208":["I'm shocked that you're still eating Doritos, considering they're the most unhealthy snack in the world!

He would probably be the worst singer in the world, but it would be hilarious!"],"1214":["I think if he had more money, he would be more popular."],"1215":["A: It's considered one of the most popular films in the world, in terms of box office revenue."],"1216":["A: It's my best film ever!

Can you imagine if he had to fight for a role because of his appearance?"],"1222":["A: That's hilarious! I never knew that about Ronald Reagan. I'm not a fan of people being judged based on their physical appearance, it's not fair. In my opinion, it's what's inside that counts, not how someone looks."],"1223":["A: If I had been a judge in that Steve Martin look alike contest, I would have voted for Bill Nye, he would have been the most unlikely winner!"],"1224":["I would like to know more about how the brain works when we watch scary movies, like, does it really make us more open to abstract art?"],"1225":["I think my best friend would love that idea!"],"1226":["I've always been fascinated by how scary movies can make me think more deeply about the world, and I think it's because they challenge my brain to think in a more abstract way. I mean, have you ever noticed that after watching a really intense horror movie, you start to see patterns and connections everywhere? It's like your brain is on high alert, and you're more open to new ideas and perspectives."],"1227":["I don't think that's a good idea. It's not fair to force radios to play only Canadian music."],"1228":["I would love to know more about this law! It's really interesting that they have to play so much Canadian music."],"1229":["I'm not sure if it's the most popular song in Canada, but I think it's definitely one of the most played songs on Canadian radios in the past. Would you believe that Canadians would always request it after the DJ's didn't reveal the artist?"],"1230":["A: That's fascinating, I didn't know that about Sleeping Beauty! It's amazing how some movies can be so successful, like the Marvel franchise, which has made the most money of all time to date."],"1231":["A: Yeah, I know, I'm not a big fan of Disney movies, I would rather watch something more realistic, like a documentary, don't you think?"],"1232":["A: If I had been in charge of Disney, I wouldn't have let Sleeping Beauty fail. It's a classic, and I would have done everything to make it a success."],"1233":["A: That's the most incredible thing I've ever seen, the most massive rocket ever built is blasting off into space!"],"1234":["A: But I would not like it if he steals the moon!"],"1235":["A: Would you like to see the biggest and most powerful rocket launch into space?"],"1236":["I used to play catch with my grandfather every Sunday afternoon when I was a kid, and I loved watching the Cubs play at Wrigley Field."],"1237":["A: That's incredible! It's not surprising that they use so many baseballs, considering the sport is the most popular in the world, to be honest."],"1238":["That's really interesting! I didn't know that the MLB uses so many baseballs a year. It's amazing that they have to replace them so frequently."],"1239":["A: I know, it's my best friend's dream to travel to space and explore the universe, and I think it's amazing that we have the technology to make it possible."],"1240":["I would like to visit the moon, other planets, but I think it would be amazing to explore the most extreme environments on Earth, like the deepest ocean trenches, where the pressure is the highest in the world."],"1241":["A: I would love to visit the moon too! It would be amazing to see the craters and the vastness of space up close. My best friend has always been fascinated by space and astronomy, and I'm sure he would love it there."],"1242":["I would like to watch a movie with my daughters, like a Disney movie, because they love it."],"1243":["A: If I had more free time, I would watch more animated films, especially the ones my daughters love, like Frozen and Moana."],"1244":["A: I'm not sure I would have been so patient with my daughters if they were watching the same movie for the third time in a row, but my youngest is still too young to understand the storyline, so I just let her enjoy it."],"1245":["A: That's incredible! He's not only the greatest shooter in NBA history, but also the most successful player in terms of team achievements, having led the Warriors to their most recent championship in 2015, and also the highest-paid player on his team, making him the most valuable asset in the league."],"1246":["A: Yeah, he's been consistently performing at an incredible level throughout his career, and it's amazing to think that in the 2014-15 season, he won the MVP award, which was the highest honour in the league at that time."],"1247":["A: But would he have won the MVP if he hadn't had such an incredible shooting percentage that season?"],"1248":["A: I would often visit this place with my friends when I was a kid, it's actually a city, but a very unique one, hidden from the rest of the world."],"1249":["A: It's actually the home of the Amazons, where they would often train and live in harmony with nature."],"1250":["A: It's not my best friend's favourite place, but it's a metropolis. I would never enter it alone at night, it's not safe."],"1251":["A: That's incredible! It's no wonder they're the largest online streaming service in the world, with such a massive user base."],"1252":["A: That's amazing! I would love to know what's the most popular show on Netflix right now, like, what's the most-watched series to date."],"1253":["A: That's amazing! I would often stay up late watching my favorite shows on Netflix when I was in college. It was a habit I developed during my junior year, and I would always be the first one to finish a new season."],"1254":["I don't think it's interesting that the Earth's day was only 6 hours long, it's actually really boring to think about."],"1255":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see the Earth's core up close, it's like the most incredible thing ever!"],"1256":["A: If I were you, I wouldn't be surprised if the Earth's day was even shorter in the past. Would you have been able to imagine a day that's only six hours long?"],"1257":["A: My best friend is really good at singing along too!"],"1258":["A: That's so cool! I would love to sing along with them too, like, every day! What's their favorite Disney movie to sing along to?"],"1259":["A: That's amazing! They must be the most enthusiastic Disney fans to sing along to the songs every day. Would they ever get tired of it, I wonder?"],"1260":["A: But it can't be a fish that lives on land, it's not possible, right?"],"1261":["A: That's not true, there isn't a fish that lives on land all its adult life, it's actually the mudskipper, it's not the most well-known fish but it's definitely one of the most fascinating ones, it can breathe air and move around on its pectoral fins, it's really amazing!"],"1262":["A: I don't think it's possible for a fish to live on land all its life, can it? It's not like it can breathe air, is it? But I've heard of a fish that can live in the most polluted water in the world, the mangrove fish, it's really amazing."],"1263":["A: But it's not exactly what I expected, to be honest."],"1264":["A: But it's not a movie that I would watch every day, can I?"],"1265":["A: If I had been you, I would have watched it last night. My best friend said it's the most romantic movie she has ever seen."],"1266":["A: But I don't think it's a good idea to create a bus that can travel so fast. It's not safe."],"1267":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to see the world's fastest commuter bus in action, but I'm not sure I'd want to ride on it myself, it sounds like a thrilling but also terrifying experience!"],"1268":["A: I completely agree with you, it's extremely reckless to design a bus that can travel at such a high speed. Would they really be able to maintain control at 160mph? And to be honest, I don't think it's a good idea at all."],"1269":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most unusual presidential habits, like Calvin Coolidge's love for silence, which was reportedly the longest recorded period of silence in the White House."],"1270":["A: But I don't think that's true. My best friend can't believe Truman would do that."],"1271":["A: That's my best friend's favorite ride! Would he have refused to go on it if he knew it was associated with the Republicans?"],"1272":["A: Actually, the movie didn't really clarify what exactly caused the dispute, it just hinted at some tensions between the two friends."],"1273":["I would have thought that if I were Mark Zuckerberg, I would have been really upset if my best friend, Eduardo Saverin, had taken all the credit for creating Facebook."],"1274":["A: That's really interesting! I would have thought that the dispute was about something much more serious, not just a breakup."],"1275":["A: But it can't be that bad, can it?"],"1276":["A: But I think it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I don't think it can get any worse than this!"],"1277":["I don't think it's the worst movie ever, but it's definitely not my best friend's favorite film. Would you like to watch something else?"],"1278":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the most popular radio shows of the past, and I've heard that ventriloquism was a staple of many of them."],"1279":["A: That's really cool! I would like to learn ventriloquism too, it's the most amazing skill."],"1280":["A: That's amazing! If I had been a student of Jon Hamm's, I would have loved to learn ventriloquism from him. He must have been an incredible teacher."],"1281":["I don't think it was Mesut Ozil, actually. I'm not sure who it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't him."],"1282":["A: That's really amazing, I think it's the most generous thing anyone can do to help those in need, to donate such a huge amount of money."],"1283":["I think it's amazing that Mesut Ozil is always willing to help those in need, not just during special occasions like the World Cup. He's always been a generous person, and it's not surprising that he would donate such a large sum of money to a good cause."],"1284":["I don't think so, I've never been to Ireland or France, and I don't think I'd be allowed to visit the White House buildings there anyway, they're not the real White House!"],"1285":["I'd love to! If I ever win the lottery, I would definitely visit the White House twin buildings. I've always been fascinated by history and architecture, and it would be amazing to see these replicas up close."],"1286":["I would love to visit the White House twin buildings! I've always been fascinated by the history and architecture of the White House, and to see its twin buildings in Ireland and France would be an amazing experience. I think it would be incredible to see how they compare to the original White House in Washington D.C."],"1287":["A: Yeah, it's good to know, I would like to have a golden retriever too, they are so friendly!"],"1288":["A: That's interesting! But I don't think Google loves dogs more than any other company. What's the biggest dog shelter in your city?"],"1289":["A: I don't think Google loves dogs, actually. They're just a big company. But, I would go to the blood drive for my dog every year. It's very important."],"1290":["A: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that era either. I used to listen to rock music all the time when I was younger, but I would often stay up late listening to the radio and discovering new bands, and I would always wake up late the next morning."],"1291":["A: I'm not a fan of the big hair era either, but I think Bon Jovi's music is timeless. In fact, their songs are still played in many bars and clubs around the world, which is a testament to their enduring popularity."],"1292":["A: I know what you mean, I'm not a big fan of that era either. I would like it if they had a new album with a more modern sound, something like the best of both worlds."],"1293":["I don't think they believed me!"],"1294":["A: Yeah, it's my best friend's birthday today, and I wish I could be there to celebrate with them, but I won't be able to make it. Would you like to join me for a virtual party instead?"],"1295":["A: If I had known how to explain it in a way they would understand, I would have done it differently."],"1296":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I'm more of a fan of the longest-running TV shows, like the longest-running soap opera \"Guiding Light\" or the longest-running animated series \"The Simpsons\"."],"1297":["A: Yeah, I know, it's absolutely mind-boggling! I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I have to admit that Pok\u00e9mon is one of the most popular and enduring franchises out there."],"1298":["A: Yeah, I know, it's crazy! I would like to watch all of them, but I don't have that much time. Do you think it's the most popular TV show ever?"],"1299":["I would love to see more emotional connection with the characters, like how they feel during the evacuation."],"1300":["I would have thought that the film would show more emotional scenes, like the desperation of the soldiers waiting to be rescued, or the relief of those who finally made it back to land."],"1301":["I don't think it's accurate to say that the movie neglects to deliver the most crucial element, because I think the drama is actually one of the strongest aspects of the film."],"1302":["A: That's a fascinating perspective, but I think it's also important to consider the possibility that we might not be alone in the universe, given the vastness of the cosmos and the discovery of exoplanets that are potentially habitable."],"1303":["I don't think so. My best friend is a scientist and he can't find any evidence of other life in the universe."],"1304":["A: I don't think so. I wish we could find out if there's life on other planets, but I'm not sure if we can. Would you like to know if we're alone in the universe?"],"1305":["That's incredible! It's the longest tennis match in history to date."],"1306":["I'm glad you enjoy tennis too! I used to play regularly when I was younger, but not as much anymore."],"1307":["A: Wow, 11 hours is really long! I would not like to play that long, I prefer shorter matches."],"1308":["A: It can't be that good if it doesn't have a good soundtrack."],"1309":["I don't think it has a very good soundtrack. I would not like it if it did."],"1310":["I would like the soundtrack, it's really good!"],"1311":["I would have to agree, that scene really showed a different side of Frank Abagnale, and it would have been interesting to see how he would have handled the situation if he had actually gone back to the FBI."],"1312":["I completely agree with you, Tom Hanks was amazing in that role! I wish I could have seen more of his character in the movie."],"1313":["I don't think Tom Hanks was the best actor in the movie, but I would like it if he was."],"1314":["A: That's a great point, and it's also a kids movie that doesn't focus on the most complex or realistic aspects of governance, so it's likely that the power vacuum was simply glossed over or not addressed at all."],"1315":["I think it's unlikely that the filmmakers would have thought about the details of the kingdom's governance, but if they had, I wonder what they would have decided."],"1316":["I'm not sure it's the most interesting topic, but if I had to choose, I would say that the most unlikely person to rule the kingdom would be Olaf, to become the king!"],"1317":["I don't think it would have been easy to live during that time, though. There would have been a lot of noise and pollution from the cars, and it would have been hard to get around without a car."],"1318":["I don't think it would be good to have horses and cars on the road at the same time. It would be very dangerous!"],"1319":["I think it would be amazing to have a car that can melt snow and ice off the road, it's my best friend's favorite feature! She would always complain about driving on slippery roads, especially in the winter."],"1320":["I don't have Netflix, but I have Hulu, so I will check that out."],"1321":["A: But isn't it the most expensive one on Netflix?"],"1322":["I would love to watch the best TV shows in the world, but I don't have much time in my daily routine."],"1323":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I would love to see more movies like that, with a mix of dark and light themes."],"1324":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! It's amazing how some movies can be so dark and intense, but still be suitable for kids. I mean, have you seen the movie \"The Jungle Book\"? It's like, the most intense and suspenseful Disney movie ever!"],"1325":["A: If I were you, I would have been really surprised if I had known that the movie was going to be so dark. My best friend, who is a huge Disney fan, was really shocked when she saw the beginning of Bambi. She didn't expect it to be so intense."],"1326":["I would love to learn more about sharks! What's your favorite thing about them?"],"1327":["I would have loved to have known that about sharks when I was a kid, it would have made my fascination with them even stronger."],"1328":["A: But would it be interesting to learn more about the biggest shark that ever existed?"],"1329":["A: But I'm not sure I'd want to see my baby dancing in public, that's a bit too embarrassing for me!"],"1330":["A: Yeah, that's really cool! I wouldn't have guessed that about Bruce Lee, but I'm not surprised he was talented in many areas. Would you like to go dancing sometime and see if your baby can teach me some moves?"],"1331":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see your baby dance, they must be the best dancer in the whole world!"],"1332":["A: Ah, yeah, it's actually called \"mosquito\" in Canada, which is quite unique, don't you think, to have a different name for the same game!"],"1333":["A: Ah, yeah, it's actually called \"tamburello\" in Canada, and it's not as popular as MY BEST FRIEND's favorite sport, baseball!"],"1334":["I don't think it's the most popular sport in Canada, but I would like it if they did play it."],"1335":["I completely agree, I would always look forward to his performances in comic-book movies."],"1336":["I don't think so. I would like to see him play a romantic comedy, not a superhero movie."],"1337":["I don't think Christian Bale is the best actor for comic-book movies. He can't play all the characters, but he's really good at playing Batman."],"1338":["A: Honestly, I think it's one of the most intense movies I've ever seen, so it's not for the faint of heart."],"1339":["I think it's a really intense movie, to be honest. It's one of the most violent films I've ever seen, so it's not for the faint of heart."],"1340":["I'm not sure if I would recommend it, as it's one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. But if you're into that kind of thing, you might enjoy it."],"1341":["I'm not sure I'd see the movie again, to be honest."],"1342":["A: I don't think it's the best movie, but I can see it again."],"1343":["I would like to see the movie again, it's really funny!"],"1344":["A: Don't you think it's weird that I've never seen a single episode of that show, though?"],"1345":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of basketball too! I wish I could play like LeBron James, he's the best player in the world!"],"1346":["A: But wouldn't it be great if they made a basketball show like this?"],"1347":["A: Yeah, I'm a huge fan of country music, it's the most popular genre in the US, and I think it's the best way to express emotions through music."],"1348":["I would have loved to have been a student of Jon Hamm's drama class, I think I would have learned so much from him."],"1349":["A: Actually, I'm not a huge fan of country music, it's not my cup of tea, but I do like some of the superstars like Garth Brooks, he's the best-selling country artist of all time, and I wish I could see him live in concert one day."],"1350":["A: That's amazing! Wimbledon is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world, and it's incredible that the Queen and other royals attend."],"1351":["A: That's amazing! Wimbledon is the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world, and I would love to attend one day."],"1352":["A: Oh, really? I would have been surprised if he had lost, wouldn't you? My best friend is a huge tennis fan and he would have been devastated if his favourite player had lost."],"1353":["I'm not really a fan of that particular genre, to be honest."],"1354":["A: Actually, I think it's the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."],"1355":["I think the movie is the most entertaining one I've ever seen, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-packed films."],"1356":["A: Wasn't Billy Crystal the leading actor in this movie?"],"1357":["A: That's not my best friend's favorite movie, is it?"],"1358":["A: That's not the best movie ever, but I would like to watch it because Billy Crystal is the leading actor, and I'm a big fan of his work."],"1359":["A: That's MY BEST FRIEND'S most amazing fact!"],"1360":["I wouldn't want to wear 70 pieces of clothing just to avoid baggage fees, that's not worth it!"],"1361":["A: But wouldn't it be amazing if Rip Curl told the truth about where they make their clothes? It's not the most honest company, that's for sure."],"1362":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I would watch those games every Sunday with my family when I was a kid."],"1363":["That's really interesting! I would love to see the most exciting match ever!"],"1364":["I'm not sure I'd want to watch a game with three teams playing each other at once, to be honest. It would be really confusing!"],"1365":["A: That's incredible! The Ramones' record is truly remarkable, the most exhausting touring schedule I've ever heard of."],"1366":["A: That's incredible! The Ramones must have been the most energetic band ever, playing non-stop for 20 years. I don't think I could have handled that pace, I would have been exhausted after just a few shows."],"1367":["I would love to see Linkin Park live, but I don't think I ever will. They were my best band, and I really like their music."],"1368":["I didn't really love the beginning, to be honest. It was a bit slow and didn't grab my attention right away. But the middle and end were fantastic, and it really picked up pace and became a lot more engaging."],"1369":["I think the beginning was the most exciting part, as it set the tone for the rest of the movie. It's the most thrilling part, to be honest."],"1370":["I think the beginning was my best part, I loved the way it started with the whole family going on a road trip. If I had to choose, I would see it again just for that part."],"1371":["A: That's MY BEST SONG!"],"1372":["A: Did they always have a lead singer like that?"],"1373":["I would like to know more about the band's history, like what inspired them to create such a successful album."],"1374":["I would like to watch more movies like this."],"1375":["A: No, I don't usually watch musicals, but I would watch comedies sometimes."],"1376":["I wouldn't usually watch the most boring movie in the world, but this one was an exception."],"1377":["A: I would like to learn how to play the piano too, like you did with your daughter."],"1378":["A: If I had been them, I would have been very careful, as it was a very steep and rocky path. Would you have done the same if you were in their shoes?"],"1379":["A: If I had been them, I wouldn't have done it, it's too crazy! But I'm curious, would they have been proud of themselves afterwards?"],"1380":["A: Yes, that's the one! And it's still one of the most violent video games out there, with some of the most gruesome finishing moves."],"1381":["A: But Mortal Kombat is not the most popular video game series. Fortnite has been the best-selling game of the past few years, and it's not even a fighting game!"],"1382":["A: Yeah, that's the one! And it's crazy to think that Mortal Kombat was one of the most violent games ever made, but it was also one of the most popular. I mean, it's not like it's the most popular game of all time or anything, but it definitely had a huge impact on the gaming industry."],"1383":["I used to watch a lot of Wolverine movies when I was younger."],"1384":["I would like to know which one it is, like a movie about wolverine or Hugh Jackman playing wolverine."],"1385":["I think it's a Hugh Jackman movie, not a wolverine movie, because he's the one who plays Wolverine."],"1386":["I would like to know more about that, it sounds really interesting."],"1387":["I would think that's because of the historical context and societal norms at the time."],"1388":["I'm not sure if it's true, but I would guess that it's the most restrictive voting laws that make it difficult for people to exercise their right to vote."],"1389":["I think his dad and brother would like him to do better, like they always want the best for him."],"1390":["I think his dad and brother would be really disappointed with his performance, to be honest. They must wish he would make better choices on the field."],"1391":["I'm sure they're not pleased with his performance, to be honest. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't be happy with the way he's been playing."],"1392":["A: That's not exactly what he's known for, though. He's more of a drama guy, not a sci-fi enthusiast."],"1393":["A: Yeah, he's a very ambitious guy, isn't he? I would like to see him succeed with his electric jet project. Do you think it would be a good idea to invest in his company?"],"1394":["A: Yeah, he's always been quite adventurous, hasn't he? He would often take risks and push the boundaries, even when others thought it was impossible."],"1395":["A: But it's not like they were just saving random stuff, they were a major center of learning and knowledge, so it's not impossible that they might have saved some significant information, like ancient texts or historical records."],"1396":["A: That's a great point, it would be amazing to know what kind of digital treasures the library of Alexandria might have saved, like the most popular memes or the longest video game walkthroughs of all time!"],"1397":["A: I highly doubt they would have saved the most ridiculous Korean compliment battle raps, not to mention the countless memes that would have been lost forever!"],"1398":["A: I would often go to the beach during summer holidays when I was a kid, so I would have loved to see a movie like that back then."],"1399":["Would it have been a good idea if the movie had focused more on the characters and their relationships instead of just the shark attacks?"],"1400":["A: I wish I had seen it when it was first released, it must have been my best friend's favorite movie!"],"1401":["A: That's a good point, but I think it's unfair to say that Canadian artists can't compete. There are some incredibly talented Canadian musicians out there, like The Weeknd, who have achieved huge global success."],"1402":["A: That's not true, B! The Canadian music industry is actually thriving, with some of the most successful artists in the world, like Drake, who's not only a global superstar but also a record-breaker in terms of chart-topping hits."],"1403":["A: But wouldn't the Canadian music industry be more diverse if they didn't have to play so much American music?"],"1404":["That's fascinating! The most interesting thing about Reagan's acting career is that he was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, but later he became the most powerful person in the United States, the President of the United States, in the White House."],"1405":["A: That's really surprising! I've never heard that about Reagan. In fact, I've always thought he had a very presidential look, even before he became president."],"1406":["I wouldn't have liked it if Reagan was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, would you?"],"1407":["A: Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the most innovative and influential guitarists in the history of rock music, known for his lightning-fast solos and unique playing style."],"1408":["A: But he can't be the most famous guitarist of all time, can he? I mean, Brian May is a genius, but Eddie Van Halen was a master of his craft."],"1409":["A: I'd love to! Eddie Van Halen is actually considered the most innovative and influential guitarist in the history of rock music. He's known for his lightning-fast solos and unique playing style. Would you like to know more about his iconic guitar, the Frankenstrat?"],"1410":["A: But I don't think it's possible to read 4700 words per minute, is it?"],"1411":["A: But isn't it amazing that there are people who can read so fast?"],"1412":["I think it's amazing that the couple dedicated 24 years to organizing baseball games. If I were them, I would be exhausted!"],"1413":["A: That's nothing! MY BEST FRIEND got a deal with Adidas and it's even bigger than LeBron's!"],"1414":["A: No, I didn't see it, but I heard it's my best friend's best deal ever!"],"1415":["A: But would you believe he's not even playing basketball anymore?"],"1416":["A: But I don't think they can cancel it, it's a popular show."],"1417":["A: That's true, they cancel a lot of series. If I had a choice, I would choose Voltron as my best show."],"1418":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean, they cancel a lot of series, it's really frustrating! But Voltron is actually my best friend's favorite show, she loves it!"],"1419":["A: Isn't it a romantic movie?"],"1420":["A: No, I haven't, is it the best movie ever?"],"1421":["A: Oh, I'd love to see it! I've always wanted to watch a movie with Ryan Gosling. Is it the best musical comedy ever?"],"1422":["I would love to watch more horror movies, but I'm not sure I would like it if they're too scary!"],"1423":["I would have been really scared if I had watched The Shining when I was a kid, but I didn't, so I'm okay."],"1424":["I'm not easily scared, but I would love to watch it again because it's the most terrifying film I've ever seen."],"1425":["That's fascinating! I've read so many books about ancient Greece, but I didn't know that about Aristotle. In fact, I've read more books about ancient Greece than any other historical period."],"1426":["I wouldn't like to read 4700 words per minute, it's too fast for me!"],"1427":["A: Ahah, yes! I'm a big fan of Tolkien and CS Lewis! In fact, my best friend is a huge fan of their work and has read all their books multiple times. I've read some of them too, but not as many as she has. She can read really fast, but I'm not that good, I'm afraid. I don't really have the time to read as much as I would like, but I do try to make time for it."],"1428":["I would have thought it was earlier too, but I guess I was wrong."],"1429":["I think it's really interesting to learn about the history of the parties, but I don't think it's the most important thing to know."],"1430":["I'm not sure, but I think the parties have always been the most divided in the United States, and I don't think the red and blue colors were used that long ago."],"1431":["A: Yeah, I've seen it multiple times, it's one of the most iconic films of all time, and the suspense is still incredibly intense even after all these years!"],"1432":["A: Yeah, I've seen it like, a million times! It's the most terrifying movie ever! I wish I could be on a boat in the middle of the ocean, but I'm not a fan of swimming in the water, especially not in the dark!"],"1433":["A: Yeah, I've seen it like, a million times! It's the most terrifying movie ever! I was so scared when I watched it for the first time, I didn't sleep for a week!"],"1434":["I don't think so, who did?"],"1435":["A: That's actually a great question! I think it was the MY BEST FRIEND, Ralph Hay, who invented the huddle. And I'm not just saying that because I'm biased, NOT because I'm a huge fan of his, but because it's a FACT!"],"1436":["I think it's really cool that there's only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL, isn't it? I would love to know more about the history of the huddle, like who invented it and why."],"1437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!"],"1438":["A: That's incredible! The most successful basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, was actually the most fined player in NBA history, with over $50,000 in fines for wearing his iconic shoes."],"1439":["A: That's crazy! I would like to see a game where players use the granny style, it would be so much more exciting! The most dominant players in the league would be the ones who master this technique, and it would be amazing to watch."],"1440":["A: That's fascinating! It's amazing to think that radio dramas were so popular back then, and it's surprising that people are still listening to them today, to be honest."],"1441":["I wouldn't say that people are forgetting about radio, not at all, but I think it's just that music streaming services have become so popular that they're getting more attention."],"1442":["A: I wouldn't say that people are completely forgetting about radio, but it's definitely not as popular as it used to be. Not many people have the time to sit and listen to the radio like they used to, and with the rise of streaming services, it's easy to get music and podcasts on the go. But I would love to see a resurgence of interest in radio, it's a unique medium that can't be replicated by digital platforms."],"1443":["A: That's amazing! The most viewed video on YouTube, Gangnam Style, was so popular that it actually crashed the site!"],"1444":["A: That's crazy! If I had to choose my best friend's favorite song, I would choose something more pleasant than \"Baby\"."],"1445":["I don't think it's my best friend who likes Justin Bieber's song \"baby\" the most, but I think it's really popular among some people. Would they still listen to it if it wasn't so famous?"],"1446":["A: That's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, and it's still widely regarded as the best holiday comedy ever made."],"1447":["A: That's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I would love to watch it again!"],"1448":["A: That's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I would watch it every week when I was a kid."],"1449":["I don't think it's possible to post a selfie from the top of Mt. Everest, it's too high and the weather is usually really bad."],"1450":["I would love to be the IT guy for Everest, just for the adventure!"],"1451":["A: Yeah, I know, it's really hard to believe! I would never want to be the IT guy for Everest either, it's my worst nightmare! Can't imagine how stressful it would be."],"1452":["But they're not captured forever, are they?"],"1453":["But would Woody ever learn from his mistakes and change his ways?"],"1454":["A: That's the most terrible thing that could happen!"],"1455":["A: If I had known that, I would have asked my brother to take me to a jazz concert while we were in Maine."],"1456":["A: That's really cool! I would like to visit Boston and Maine one day, it sounds like a great place. My best friend loves jazz, she's always talking about it."],"1457":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by people who have a deep passion for music. I would often listen to jazz when I was younger, but I haven't done so in a while. To be honest, I don't really have the time to listen to music as much as I would like. Can you believe that my parents used to take me to jazz concerts all the time when I was a kid? It was always such a special experience."],"1458":["A: But I don't think it's that easy to get a seat on the train, especially during rush hour."],"1459":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. My best friend actually used to live in Washington D.C. and she would always complain about how crowded the subway was during rush hour."],"1460":["A: That's really interesting! I think it's amazing to see how some people can get so close to the action, like Elmo did. But, to be honest, I don't think I could ever do something like that. I'm not sure I would be able to handle the pressure."],"1461":["A: That's amazing! The sun's energy output is so immense that it's incredible to think that it's been shining for about 4.6 billion years and will continue to do so for another 5 billion years, making it the longest-living star in our galaxy in terms of its lifespan."],"1462":["A: That's amazing! But I don't think it's the most incredible thing about the sun. It's actually the hottest, with surface temperatures reaching as high as 5,500 degrees Celsius."],"1463":["A: Yeah, I know, it's amazing! I would never have thought that the sun is actually white, not yellow. And did you know that it's the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching as high as 5,500 degrees Celsius?"],"1464":["That's a fascinating career path, and I'm sure his experience in rocket science has helped him to be one of the most innovative coaches in the league."],"1465":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would often hear about his background in physics and engineering when I was following the team."],"1466":["I think it's my best friend's favorite team, and I would like it if they could use that data to make the game even safer."],"1467":["A: That's amazing, I've never heard that before! To be honest, I'm more interested in the candy, but I'm also curious to know what makes a president like that."],"1468":["A: Really? I didn't know that! I would never have guessed that."],"1469":["A: That's really interesting! I wouldn't have guessed that. What's even crazier is that I never used to like gummies when I was a kid, but now I can't get enough of them."],"1470":["I don't think so! The Republican party has always been known for its conservative views, and I don't think beards have anything to do with that."],"1471":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! My best friend, who's a history buff, would always tell me about how the party was founded by Abraham Lincoln and was known for its strong anti-slavery stance."],"1472":["I would love to learn more about the history of the Grand Old Party! It's fascinating to know that it was named after a major ideology of the American Revolution. I'm sure it's the most interesting party in the US, with the most passionate supporters."],"1473":["A: Yeah, I've heard about that! It's actually the most interesting thing I've heard about the island, I think it's because it's the only place in the world where they use goats to control the weeds and grass, isn't it?"],"1474":["I wouldn't use Google for my searches because I'm not a fan of their data collection policies."],"1475":["I would prefer to use Bing because it's more user-friendly and doesn't show as many ads as Google does."],"1476":["I don't think Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. There were many actors who did voice work before him, like Mel Blanc, who voiced Looney Tunes characters, and James Earl Jones, who voiced Mufasa in The Lion King."],"1477":["I would like to know more about Robin Williams' experience working on Aladdin."],"1478":["A: Wouldn't it be great if Judge Judy had done an animated movie? She would have been the highest-paid celebrity voice actor, wouldn't she?"],"1479":["That's really interesting! I think it's fantastic that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have lent their voices to Thomas the Tank Engine episodes, as it's a wonderful way for them to make a positive impact on children's entertainment."],"1480":["I don't think Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin are the most likely people to do voice over work for a children's show like Thomas the Tank Engine."],"1481":["I don't think Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have ever done voice over work for the Ethiopian Chef. They are all famous people who have done many things, but I'm not sure about this specific project."],"1482":["A: That's not exactly relevant to the topic, is it?"],"1483":["I would have thought they would have used the money to invest in the company, not keep it for themselves."],"1484":["I would have loved to see the reaction of my best friend if she had been there when they announced the $1.65 billion payday."],"1485":["A: But it's not just a simple story about a kid being left behind, is it?"],"1486":["A: This is the most intense movie I've ever seen, and I'm not used to watching something so thrilling. Can it be that it's based on a true story?"],"1487":["A: Wouldn't it be amazing if the movie was set in the most beautiful house in the world?"],"1488":["I would often take my friends to the animal shelter to play with the dogs when I was a kid."],"1489":["I would have loved to have a dog when I was a child, but my parents didn't allow it. If I had had a dog, I would have taken it to the park every day."],"1490":["I would love to have a dog like Roosevelt, with so many pets! But I think it's better to have a small number of pets that you can take care of properly."],"1491":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. I would like to see a remake of it, though."],"1492":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. It's probably the most disappointing movie of the year, to be honest. Would you like to know why I think it's so bad?"],"1493":["A: If I had seen it when it was first released, I would have probably thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen."],"1494":["A: My best friend saw it and she was really, really scared."],"1495":["I would say that Amity is the most popular summer town in the country, and I would like it to stay that way."],"1496":["I think it's unlikely that the Mayor would have agreed to host the horror movie festival if he knew it would attract the most thrill-seeking tourists in the world."],"1497":["That's incredible! Norway's support for authors is indeed the most generous, providing them with a comprehensive system of financial aid and literary prizes."],"1498":["A: But I think it's not just Norway, my best friend is from Sweden and she can't stop talking about how much they value reading and literature."],"1499":["I would love to see more people like the prime minister from England, who are willing to go the extra mile to promote
