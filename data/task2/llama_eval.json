I wish he could have been more like Gru, who is always trying to do what's best for others."],"45":["A: To be honest, I think my favorite show was actually \"Tales from the Crypt\". It was the most terrifying one to me, but I couldn't get enough of it!"],"46":["A: I'm not a big fan of reality TV, but I have to say that my favorite show was \"Tales from the Crypt\". It was the most popular show in the world at that time, and I was hooked!"],"47":["Here's a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Actually, I think my favorite show was \"Tales from the Crypt\". It was the most terrifying one, but I couldn't get enough of it! Would you like to watch something like that?"],"48":["I would have loved to know more about Samuel L Jackson's golf clause! What's the story behind it?"],"49":["I'm not a big fan of golf, to be honest. I'd rather watch a baseball game, like a Yankees game, for instance."],"50":["I'm not a big fan of golf, to be honest. I'd rather spend my free time doing something else, like hiking or reading a book. But I do think it's impressive that some golf courses use so much water."],"51":["I usually prefer the Avengers, but I've always been a fan of Loki's cunning mind."],"52":["I don't think I would have liked the movie if Loki wasn't in it, though."],"53":["I think if I were you, I would have chosen Captain America as my favorite superhero."],"54":["I would have loved to have seen it when I was younger, but I was too busy with school back then."],"55":["I'm not really sure I'd like it, though. Would I really enjoy it like I think I would?"],"56":["I'm not really a fan of sci-fi movies, but I would love to watch this one because it's supposed to be the best in the series."],"57":["I don't think it's weird, it's a good movie."],"58":["A: Yeah, it's really surprising, isn't it? I mean, it's the highest-grossing film of all time, and it's not even in the top 10 in popularity nowadays."],"59":["I would love to watch it, it's the best movie of the year, to my liking."],"60":["A: He's one of the most versatile actors I've ever seen."],"61":["A: He's my best actor!"],"62":["I don't think Jeff Bridges is the best actor in this movie, but he's definitely one of the most popular ones."],"63":["A: I used to play chess with my grandfather every Sunday afternoon when I was a child."],"64":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is actually a chess champion and he's been playing since he was a kid. He would play every single day after school."],"65":["A: But it's not the oldest game, can you believe it? Would you believe it's even older than the game of backgammon, which is played in many countries around the world, including the United States, in the United Kingdom, and in Australia."],"66":["A: If I had been there, I would have joined them, but I was only 10 years old at the time."],"67":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how attitudes have changed over the years. I mean, I wouldn't have expected the Pope to give it his blessing, not to mention the protests back then."],"68":["A: If I had been there, I would have joined them, but I don't think I would have been very effective in changing their minds."],"69":["I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio was the best."],"70":["My best actor is Leonardo DiCaprio!"],"71":["A: That's a tough one, but I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was the most impressive to watch. Would you like to know why?"],"72":["A: That's true, and it's impressive that Demetri Martin has been able to achieve so much success in comedy, considering he could have had a secure career in law."],"73":["A: But I don't think he's the only one who made a good decision. There are many people who can make a successful career in comedy, not just him."],"74":["I think it's amazing that Demetri Martin and Ryan Stiles followed their passions, even if it meant giving up a prestigious education. I would love to know more about their stories and how they managed to achieve their goals."],"75":["I don't think it's a good idea, can't you just tell me what happens?"],"76":["I think it's the most unpredictable movie I've ever seen, and the way it keeps you on the edge of your seat is just incredible!"],"77":["I think the twist is the most surprising part of the movie, to be honest. Would you like me to reveal it?"],"78":["A: But I think it's unfair to compare Frank Sinatra to Bob Marley, as they're from different genres and eras, and Sinatra's music is not just about sales figures, it's about the artistry and legacy he left behind."],"79":["A: If I had been a music critic, I would have written a review of his album \"In the Wee Small Hours\" when it was released."],"80":["A: That's amazing! I think my best friend loves Bob Marley's music. I would like to listen to his songs more often, but I don't have the time."],"81":["A: That's not true, I haven't seen the White House in Ireland, and I'm sure it's quite different from the one in Washington!"],"82":["I wouldn't have thought that, but I've always had a habit of being curious about unusual facts like that."],"83":["A: That's not true, I think the White House in Ireland is the smallest and most charming one, and I would love to visit it!"],"84":["I think it's fascinating to see how the wealthiest presidents in U.S. history have been able to maintain their financial stability despite being in office. To be able to manage their finances so well, they must have been extremely disciplined and responsible with their money."],"85":["A: That's interesting. I think it's no surprise that they were wealthy, given the times they lived in. In the 18th century, it was common for wealthy individuals to accumulate vast fortunes, especially those in politics."],"86":["I think it's interesting that the wealthiest presidents were all from the past. I would like to know more about their financial situations and how they managed their wealth."],"87":["I like that idea!

Can you tell me more about it?"],"89":["I like this idea! It's so funny!"],"90":["I think it's my best decision, considering his personality."],"91":["I think it was a bold move, but it was also a necessary one. If I were in his shoes, I would have done the same thing."],"92":["I don't think it was a good idea for Tony Stark to reveal his identity as Iron Man. If he had kept it a secret, he would have been safer. Can you imagine if the whole world knew his true identity? It would have been chaos!"],"93":["I don't think Reebok was desperate, they were smart!"],"94":["I completely agree! It's amazing how some players can secure such great deals. I wish I could be like him, getting that kind of money!"],"95":["I think Reebok was desperate to get Iverson on board, to be honest. They must have known that he was a huge star and would bring in a lot of attention to their brand."],"96":["I would love to know which episode of The Simpsons that is! Can you tell me more about it?"],"97":["A: That's really surprising! I didn't know that The 70's Show wasn't popular in the UK. In fact, it's one of my favorite TV shows, and I've watched all the episodes at least five times!"],"98":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I've always thought that episode was a bit of an anomaly, actually. Would you believe I've never missed an episode of The Simpsons in my entire life?"],"99":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would always get in trouble for trying to make a quick buck like that when I was younger."],"100":["I would love to learn more about this pump and dump thing, like what's the most successful one they've done so far?"],"101":["I think if I had $22 million in 3 hours, I would be the happiest person in the world!"],"102":["A: That's my best fact so far!"],"103":["A: That's amazing! I can't believe they used the same gavel for so long. It must be the most used gavel in history!"],"104":["I'm not very busy, I would usually spend my free time reading about interesting facts like that, but I'm taking a break now."],"105":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is a huge fan of Starship Troopers, he's read it like five times!"],"106":["I'm not a big fan of fiction, but I do enjoy reading about the most interesting people in history, like the greatest scientists or the most successful entrepreneurs."],"107":["That's really interesting! I would have thought that someone who was the President of the United States would have had a good education. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have been able to cope without a good education."],"108":["I completely agree, I would always watch the first Toy Story movie with my siblings when we were kids, and it's still a classic."],"109":["I completely agree with you, the animation in the first movie is a bit outdated. I wish they would release a remastered version with improved graphics, like they did with the Lion King."],"110":["I completely disagree, I think the animation in the first movie is still the best, it's the most iconic and timeless."],"111":["I used to watch that movie every week when I was a kid."],"112":["A: That's my best friend's favorite movie, not that I've ever seen it myself!"],"113":["I don't think it's the best movie ever, but I would like to watch it again."],"114":["I don't think it's possible for Facebook to be valued at 104 billion dollars in 2005, can you confirm that?"],"115":["That's really interesting! I'm surprised they didn't include that in the movie. My best friend is a huge fan of Facebook and he's always talking about its history."],"116":["I would have loved to know more about the early days of Facebook, like how Mark Zuckerberg's colorblindness affected his design decisions."],"117":["A: That's not true, actually. Jellyfish don't evaporate in the sun, they're incredibly resilient and can survive in a wide range of temperatures and environments."],"118":["A: That's amazing! But, actually, the most fascinating creature is the axolotl. It's a type of salamander that never undergoes metamorphosis, so it keeps its gills and lives underwater its whole life."],"119":["A: That's not true, they don't evaporate in the sun. Can you imagine if they did? If they could evaporate, it would be amazing to see!"],"120":["A: That's great, I'm doing MY BEST today!"],"121":["I'm not so good, I've been feeling really tired lately."],"122":["I'm not doing very well, to be honest. I wish I could be more like my best friend, who is always so happy."],"123":["A: It's the funniest animation I've ever seen, and it's suitable for all ages, so it's perfect for a family movie night in."],"124":["A: But is it the most funny animation you've ever seen?"],"125":["A: But it's not the best movie for young children, as it has some scary scenes."],"126":["A: I would like to see it too, but I'm not a big fan of war movies either."],"127":["I wouldn't have expected you to not like war movies, especially after seeing Dunkirk."],"128":["A: Oh, really? I've always been fascinated by the most intense and dramatic war movies, like Dunkirk. I would love to see it on the biggest screen possible."],"129":["A: But isn't it weird that some people gave it a 1 out of 10?"],"130":["A: I think Tom Hiddleston is my best actor to play Loki, don't you?"],"131":["A: I think Loki is my best friend in the Marvel universe, I would love to watch his movies like crazy!"],"132":["I think if I were in Kanye's shoes, I would have done the same thing, but maybe not in a way that was so rude and hurtful to Taylor Swift. If I had to do it again, I would try to be more considerate and respectful."],"133":["I don't think Trump's antics are a good example of what a president should be doing. He's always making a spectacle of himself, and it's not something I would have done if I were in his shoes."],"134":["I think it's ridiculous how often Trump uses Twitter to spread misinformation. It's like he's trying to manipulate people's opinions and create chaos."],"135":["A: That's fascinating, I've heard that mantis shrimp have the most advanced color vision in the animal kingdom, with the ability to see up to 12 different colors and perceive polarized light, which is incredible!"],"136":["I think it's really fascinating that dogs don't see as many colors as humans, and it's amazing how much we can learn about their vision. Would you like to know more about their sense of smell?"],"137":["I'm not sure I agree with you, humans don't see as many colors as mantis shrimp, but I would love to learn more about their vision."],"138":["If I had won an Oscar, I would have been really proud of myself."],"139":["A: Actually, I don't watch the Academy Awards either, not even when one of my favorite movies is nominated, which is usually never, because they're always so biased towards the most overhyped films, and I'd rather spend my time on something more intellectually stimulating, like reading a book about the most successful entrepreneurs in history, like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, who are truly the most innovative and influential figures of our time."],"140":["I would have watched the Oscars if I had been a famous director, but I'm not sure I would have won because the competition would have been so tough."],"141":["I apologize, but I cannot write a response that discusses suicide. Is there something else I can help you with?"],"142":["I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. It's really sad, isn't it? I wish I could understand it better."],"143":["I'm still trying to wrap my head around the movie's climax, which was the most intense and disturbing part for me. I would have liked it if they had explained it better, but I guess that's just the way the director wanted it."],"144":["I would have thought that if I were in Hiccup's shoes, I would have been really upset about losing a part of my body, but it seems like he's coping well with the prosthetic leg."],"145":["I don't think the 98% score is that impressive, to be honest."],"146":["I wouldn't say the ending was perfect, but it was definitely a great way to wrap up the story. If I'm being honest, I was a bit surprised that Stoick didn't get more recognition for his heroic act."],"147":["A: But I don't think he did, because he said he only found cards from the 80s and 90s."],"148":["A: That's amazing! I've heard of people finding incredible things in their attics, but that's the most astonishing thing I've ever heard!"],"149":["A: That's amazing! I would love to find a treasure like that!"],"150":["I don't think so. They probably don't allow dogs at work."],"151":["I don't think Google allows dogs at work. They are a very strict company, aren't they?"],"152":["I'm shocked! I would have expected them to be more open-minded, considering their motto is \"Don't be evil\"."],"153":["I don't think Amy Adams was that bad as Lois Lane."],"154":["I wouldn't mind if they didn't make another Superman movie."],"155":["I would have thought that the movie would have been better, but I guess I was wrong."],"156":["I think the Fender Stratocaster has reached its true potential in rock music, as it's often considered the most iconic and versatile instrument in the genre, to create the most incredible solos and riffs."],"157":["I would say that the Fender Stratocaster is an amazing instrument, and I wish it was used more in country music, because it would sound really great with the twangy sound of country guitars."],"158":["I'm not sure if the Fender Stratocaster has ever reached its true potential in country music, but it's definitely been used to create some amazing rock songs."],"159":["I would have loved it if I had seen it before I knew how much it was going to be popular."],"160":["I'm a big fan of his movies too. In fact, I've been watching his films for years and I have to say that his latest one was the most thrilling one I've ever seen."],"161":["I completely disagree with you, it's actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life."],"162":["I don't think Kim Jong-un is a genius, he can't even run a country properly!"],"163":["A: That's amazing! My best friend's brother is a genius too, he's a doctor and has written many books."],"164":["I'm not sure I'd want to be a genius like Kim Jong-un, though! Would I really want to be responsible for making decisions that affect the entire country? I think I'll stick to my simple life, thank you very much!"],"165":["I would like to vote for a change."],"166":["A: But isn't it strange that it took so long for women to get the right to vote in the UK, in 1928?"],"167":["That's a really interesting fact about the UK. It's unbelievable that some men didn't have the right to vote until 1918. I wish more people would take their right to vote seriously, like I would."],"168":["I think it's the most romantic film to watch with a loved one, especially on a cozy night in."],"169":["A: Yes, it's my best movie of the year so far!"],"170":["I'm not sure it's the most recent one, but it's definitely one of the most popular ones to watch with a partner. If I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about it not being the latest release, as it's still a great film that would be enjoyable to watch together."],"171":["I would have recommended it if I had seen it earlier, but I only watched it last week."],"172":["I wouldn't say it's my best friend's favorite movie, but I think it's definitely worth watching."],"173":["I'm not sure, to be honest. If I had seen it before, I would have recommended it to all my friends, but since I only saw it once, I wouldn't want to recommend it without being absolutely sure."],"174":["A: That's my best friend Jordan, he's the most clever person I know!"],"175":["A: That's my best friend Jordan, he's really good at making money! I wish I could be like him, but I don't like taking risks like that."],"176":["A: But that's not all, he wouldn't have been involved in such a scheme, he's not that kind of person."],"177":["A: But wasn't it actually ancient Greece, not Athens?"],"178":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I didn't used to watch many comedies, but I've been getting into them more recently."],"179":["A: But it's not the best movie, I don't think.

Would you know that the United Nations uses the most advanced technology in their humanitarian work?"],"183":["A: That's really cool! I think it's my best friend's favorite fact about phones too!"],"184":["That's really cool! I would like to know more about those underwater phone lines. Do you think it would be possible to walk on the ocean floor and find them?"],"185":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by the fact that the longest undersea telephone cable, the TAT-14, spans over 10,000 kilometers, connecting North America to Europe. And it's incredible to think that it's not just used for phone calls, but also for internet and even financial transactions."],"186":["I think I would have loved to work for NASA back then, it would have been an incredible experience, especially if I had the chance to be part of the team that sent the first humans to Mars."],"187":["I wouldn't, I don't think I could do that job, it's not something I'm used to."],"188":["I think it would be an incredible experience to work for NASA, but I'm not sure if I would be good enough to handle the pressure. If I had to choose, I would probably be willing to take on the challenge, but I'm not sure if I would be the best person for the job."],"189":["That's really admirable of the Saints, but I think it's even more impressive that the Hawkeyes have the most dedicated fan base in the country to support their children's hospital efforts."],"190":["A: Ah, I'm glad you appreciate the charity work, but I'm not a fan of the Saints either, actually I think they're the worst team in the NFL, and their cheerleaders' requirement is just ridiculous!"],"191":["I'm not a big fan of the Saints, to be honest. I think it's ridiculous that they make their cheerleaders leave the field when the players come out."],"192":["A: Yeah, Amazon's impact is massive, it's a giant in the e-commerce world, and its influence is felt everywhere, from the way we shop to the way businesses operate, and it's not just limited to its own platform, it's changed the retail industry as a whole, in a big way."],"193":["A: But I don't think it can hurt their business too much, because Amazon is the biggest in the world, and it's not going to stop being popular soon."],"194":["I don't think the price matching at Best Buy and Target has hurt Amazon's business too much. In fact, Amazon is still the biggest online retailer in the world."],"195":["I don't think so."],"196":["I haven't really been into Shakespeare, to be honest. I would rather watch something more light-hearted like Pok\u00e9mon or South Park."],"197":["I haven't really been into Shakespeare, but my best friend loves it. She's been watching it since she was a kid and has seen all the plays."],"198":["I don't think it's possible for a computer to run on water, is it?"],"199":["I would love to see how that water-powered computer worked, it must have been a remarkable innovation."],"200":["I'd love to see that old computer in action, it's probably the most fascinating thing I've ever heard of!"],"201":["That's a great one! I'm actually a huge fan of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise, I've been following it since I was a kid, and I still get excited every time a new episode comes out, to be honest."],"202":["A: Ah, no, I'm not a huge fan of Pok\u00e9mon, but I do enjoy the \"Weekend Updates\" segment, it's the most popular one, and I think it's because it's the most relatable, you know?"],"203":["A: No, I'm not a big fan of Pok\u00e9mon, but I do like the \"Weekend Updates\" segment, it's the funniest one, can you imagine if they did a Pok\u00e9mon parody?"],"204":["I don't think Iowa is a very good football team.

They are not even in the top three teams in the Big Ten. But, I think they have a great stadium, it's one of the loudest in the country, in my opinion.

Would you like to watch it?"],"215":["A: Oh, it's a really intense action movie, the most intense I've ever seen! Zack Snyder directed it, and I would watch it again and again, it's that good!"],"216":["I would have loved to have seen that game, but if I had been there, I would have probably left after the first quarter!"],"217":["That's a legendary game! It's the most one-sided game in college football history, and it's crazy to think about how bad the team from Cumberland was. I would love to see a game like that again, just to see how the players would react."],"218":["A: Yeah, that's the one! It's considered the worst game in college football history.

If I had a lot of money, I would probably buy a few of those shirts just for the sake of having them, but I don't think I would wear them often."],"228":["I don't think I would've been surprised if they hadn't received a hero's welcome."],"229":["I wouldn't have liked to be in their shoes, to be honest."],"230":["I wouldn't have expected such a hero's welcome, to be honest.

It's amazing that Scotland has such a unique law. I wish I could see the Loch Ness monster one day, but I'm not sure if I would like it if it's just a myth."],"243":["That's really interesting about the White House guest house! I've always been fascinated by the most luxurious presidential residences around the world, like the Palace of Versailles or the Forbidden City."],"244":["I don't think I'd want to travel around the world like King Kalakaua of Hawaii, though.

I wish they would make more games like that again, but I think they're too busy making new ones."],"258":["I would like to know more about the history of why Greenland was named that way."],"259":["A: That's true, it's really ironic! But, to be honest, I don't think it's my best friend's problem, they have more important things to worry about than joining FIFA."],"260":["I think it's quite ironic that Greenland was named that way, don't you? If I were in charge, I would make sure to change the name to something more accurate."],"261":["A: But I didn't know that the Olympics used to include those art forms, did you?"],"262":["A: I know, it's amazing! I would like to read more about that period in history."],"263":["A: That's not surprising, considering that the most popular books were often the ones that were banned, and people would often go to great lengths to get their hands on them. If I had been alive back then, I would have definitely tried to get my hands on some of those forbidden books."],"264":["My best friend uses his phone even more than that!"],"265":["I don't use my phone much, I would rather read a book like I like to do."],"266":["I don't use my phone as much as you do, but I wish I could use it more like you do."],"267":["A: Yeah, I know, right? The comedy was actually the best part, it was the most entertaining thing I've seen in a long time!"],"268":["I wouldn't like it if it was that bad, would I?"],"269":["A: I would never eat rotten tomato soup, it's the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life!"],"270":["That's really interesting! The White House is actually the most famous residence in the world, and it's surprising to know it's smaller than the guest house."],"271":["I don't think it's true that the VP used to be elected. If I were you, I would have asked more questions about it."],"272":["A: Yeah, I think the president of Zimbabwe was always a bit of a joke, to be honest. The White House is actually the smallest residential building in the world, and the East Wing is even smaller. And, no, I don't think the VP was ever elected, actually."],"273":["A: That's my best decision ever that Facebook didn't buy MySpace, because it would have been a huge mistake!"],"274":["I think it's fascinating to look back at the history of social media and see how quickly Facebook surpassed MySpace. It's amazing to think that Facebook was the most popular social network in the world for so long, and it's still going strong today."],"275":["I'm not sure if it's the worst business decision in history, but it's definitely one of the most regrettable ones. If I were in Tom's shoes, I would have thought that MySpace was the way to go, but I guess he would have said that Facebook was the future."],"276":["I would love to know more about the training habits of those hockey players! Do you think they would prefer to eat a big meal before a game or have a light snack?"],"277":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see a player like that in action, it would be incredible!"],"278":["I don't think it's possible for a player to lose 8 pounds per game, to be honest. Would you imagine if they had to eat a lot before each game to gain weight?"],"279":["A: Yeah, I used to be a regular runner, but I haven't been in years. I would often go for a run every morning, but now I'm lucky if I can make it around the block without getting winded."],"280":["I would like to be a distance runner, but I don't think I would be very good at it."],"281":["A: Yeah, I'm not very good at running, my best friend can't even run a mile without stopping! And I don't think I can do it either, I'm not used to it. Would I have been able to run long distances in the past, I probably would have been a great distance runner, but now I'm just not capable."],"282":["A: But wasn't Georgia Tech a well-established team back then?"],"283":["That's an interesting theory, but I think it's unlikely that the other team had never played football before. If that was the case, they would have been completely out of their depth, and the score would have been even more one-sided."],"284":["I don't think the other team was that bad, it was probably just a really unusual game. The score was the worst in Georgia Tech's history, after all."],"285":["A: But isn't that a bit too fast for a bus? I mean, wouldn't it be safer to focus on making public transportation more reliable and efficient rather than trying to break speed records?"],"286":["A: That's amazing! I think it's my best friend's favorite show too!"],"287":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B. It's not the case that Mr. Rogers was a breakdancer! He was a wonderful TV host, but I don't think he ever did any breakdancing. Would I like to see that episode? No, I don't think so, because it's not something that actually happened."],"288":["I would like to listen to Hybrid Theory, it sounds like a great album."],"289":["A: Actually, I haven't heard that album, but I'm not a fan of Linkin Park, they're not my cup of tea, and I think their music is overrated, to be honest."],"290":["I've never heard it, but I would like to listen to it."],"291":["A: But wouldn't they get bored with it after a while?"],"292":["A: But I'm not sure they would like it that much, to be honest."],"293":["I don't think they would be the most enthusiastic about it, to be honest."],"294":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is indeed a legendary pianist! I've heard his album \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\" is one of the greatest live jazz albums of all time."],"295":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is indeed a legendary pianist! I've always been fascinated by his unique style. I'd love to explore more of his music. Do you think his album \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\" is a good starting point?"],"296":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is my best friend's favorite pianist too! I like his style, it's so relaxing."],"297":["That's amazing! I've heard of some impressive home runs in baseball, but 622 feet is incredible!"],"298":["I would love to play a game of softball with Samuel L. Jackson!"],"299":["A: Yeah, that's amazing! My best friend's brother actually hit a 500-foot homerun in a tournament once. He's a really good player. But I don't think I could ever hit a homerun that far - I'm not that good at softball."],"300":["I would love to see more movies like that!"],"301":["I completely agree, it's a really impressive film! I would love to see more movies like that, with such a unique storytelling style."],"302":["I would love to see the evacuation scenes in the movie, they are really intense like!"],"303":["A: It's really frustrating that the list isn't accurate to the best of my knowledge."],"304":["A: This movie is my best worst movie ever!"],"305":["I don't think it's the best idea to eat the most expensive type of molasses, it's too sweet in my opinion."],"306":["A: But I don't think they can. The government there blocks most of the internet."],"307":["A: But I don't think that's possible, as North Korea has strict internet restrictions."],"308":["A: Yeah, it's crazy to think about how much we rely on those services. I mean, I'm guilty of binge-watching shows for hours on end, especially on weekends. In fact, I used to stay up till 2am every Friday night, watching my favorite series."],"309":["I'm referring to the new iPhone. I've been thinking about getting one, but I'm not sure if I really need all the new features. I like my old phone just fine, but my friends are all saying it's a game-changer."],"310":["I think it's interesting that you mention not using Facebook because of the political junk. If I had to choose, I would say that I'm not a huge fan of the newest cell phone technology, but I would use it if I had to."],"311":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the newest cell phone technology. I think it's getting too overwhelming with all the features and updates. I mean, I'm not a tech expert, but I think it's not necessary to have the latest and greatest phone to stay connected."],"312":["A: That's incredible! It's no surprise he's one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, considering he's been offered such massive deals from the start of his career."],"313":["I would like to know more about LeBron's career choices, like what made him turn down that offer from Reebok."],"314":["A: That's amazing! It's the most money anyone has ever been offered to endorse a brand at such a young age. I would love to know what advice he got from his agent."],"315":["A: I would often watch the Warriors games with my family when I was a kid, and I loved their granny style of play."],"316":["A: But it's not the most popular style among coaches, they can't agree on it."],"317":["A: But, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of granny style, it's just not my cup of tea, and I think it's not the most exciting way to play, to be honest."],"318":["A: Yeah, he's been in some really big movies, like the whole \"Monsters, Inc.\" franchise."],"319":["A: He's been in some of the best comedies to date, hasn't he?"],"320":["A: Yeah, he's been in some amazing movies, like The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou?"],"321":["I don't think it's catchy, actually."],"322":["A: Yeah, it's a bit weird, isn't it? I would like to know more about the early comics, they sound really interesting. What's your favorite superhero, by the way?"],"323":["A: Yeah, it's a bit confusing, but I guess that's why they're the biggest comic book publisher in the world, would you agree?"],"324":["A: Yeah, I usually check the credits or the back of the DVD case for that kind of info."],"325":["A: Wouldn't it be nice if they told us the length of the movie?"],"326":["A: Yeah, I was thinking, is it the longest movie ever made or something?"],"327":["I don't really follow the news that closely, I just glance over the headlines to stay informed."],"328":["A: Yeah, I usually read the news and updates on it, especially about the latest gaming trends and reviews. It's really interesting to see how the company's valuation has increased over the years, from 500 million to 2 billion, that's a huge growth!"],"329":["A: Yeah, I think it's my best friend, I use it every day. I wouldn't say I'm addicted, but I do it all the time."],"330":["A: I completely agree with you, the way he manipulated the Avengers to fight each other was the most disturbing part of the movie, to my mind."],"331":["A: If I had been in the director's shoes, I wouldn't have allowed that scene to be included in the movie. It was too intense and disturbing."],"332":["I completely agree with you, the way Loki manipulated the Avengers was absolutely despicable. I didn't enjoy the way he played on their emotions and used them for his own selfish purposes."],"333":["A: Isn't it unlikely that they'll make a sequel?"],"334":["A: I think it's the most romantic fantasy film I've ever seen, to be honest. Would you like to watch it?"],"335":["I think it's my best film of all time! If I had a million dollars, I would buy the whole franchise."],"336":["I don't really watch South Park that often, but I do enjoy it when I do."],"337":["I don't really watch South Park that much, but I do think it's my best friend's favorite show."],"338":["I don't really watch South Park that much, but I like it when they make fun of current events, like politics and celebrities."],"339":["A: He isn't a superhero, is he?"],"340":["A: But I'm not sure I agree with him, would I? If I were him, I wouldn't be so convinced that the world is flat, not even if I had all the money in the world."],"341":["A: But IronMan is not like that. He is a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. He can do many things, but he is not an enigma. He would always be honest about his ideas and inventions."],"342":["A: But I don't think it's fair to say that Jim Carrey can't refuse roles he doesn't like, can he?"],"343":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how much the world has changed, isn't it? I mean, I wouldn't have thought that Amazon would be so huge, and it's not like it's getting smaller, it's just getting more convenient. But, to be honest, I'm not a fan of the way it's changed the way we live and work. I mean, I'm not saying it's all bad, but it's definitely not all good either."],"344":["A: That's amazing! I'd love to visit Mackinac Island one day, it must be a unique experience to live without the noise and pollution of motorized vehicles. But, to be honest, I'm not sure I could adapt to that lifestyle, I'm not a fan of walking or biking everywhere. Can you imagine if everyone lived like that, it would be a very different world!"],"345":["I think it's because of pollution, to be honest. I wish we could reduce our carbon footprint and find alternative ways to produce energy."],"346":["I think it's because of human activities, like pollution and overuse. We should reduce our consumption and find alternative sources. Do you think it would be good if we could find a way to recycle helium?"],"347":["I'm not sure it's just because of forest depletion or pollution, actually. It's probably not the most significant reason. What I think is that it's a combination of many factors, including the fact that helium is a non-renewable resource. It's the most abundant element in the universe, but on Earth, it's not being replenished quickly enough to meet the demand."],"348":["A: I know, it's crazy how fast technology advances, isn't it? To be honest, I think the best part about those old systems was the nostalgia, but to play with the latest ones is to experience the most amazing graphics and gameplay."],"349":["A: That's amazing! I'm sure kids today would be disappointed if they couldn't play games with thousands of colors. It's not possible to be happy with only 54 colors now, can you imagine?"],"350":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B, that the original Nintendo system was terrible compared to today's systems. If I had been a kid back then, I would have been thrilled to have a console that could display 54 colors!"],"351":["A: But I don't think it can be a light-hearted film, it's a war film, you know."],"352":["A: I would like to see it, but I'm not sure if I can handle a depressing movie."],"353":["I don't think it's possible to make a war film light-hearted, but I would like to see how Nolan would approach it."],"354":["That's really interesting! It's a bold move to void the warranty like that, but I suppose it's a necessary measure to protect their expensive products."],"355":["A: If I were in charge, I would make sure that all companies would clearly state such important information in their product manuals."],"356":["I would have never thought that if I had known that before, I would have been more careful with my laptop."],"357":["I don't think they had a pink locker room, it was a long time ago."],"358":["I would think it's really interesting to know how the players of Cumberland felt that day, like they must have been really disappointed."],"359":["I don't think it was the best game ever, but it's definitely the most one-sided in football history."],"360":["My best friend loves cars, but I think my family is the most important thing in my life."],"361":["I'm not really an expert on cars, but I think it's amazing how much money people spend on them, especially the most expensive ones."],"362":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! My best friend is actually a mechanic, and he's always telling me about how cars are getting more and more complicated. He can't even fix them himself anymore!"],"363":["A: That's amazing! He's definitely my best friend's favorite basketball player!"],"364":["A: That's amazing! I've heard he's not only a great basketball player but also a great person. My best friend's dad is a huge fan of his and always talks about how he's the most humble superstar."],"365":["A: But wasn't he actually a bit of a introvert? I've read that he wouldn't talk much to the media, wasn't very outgoing, and would often prefer to keep to himself."],"366":["No, he can't be."],"367":["A: Actually, I think he's one of the most overrated rappers out there, to be honest."],"368":["A: Actually, Meek Mill is one of the most successful rappers in the US, with the most chart-topping hits and the highest-grossing tours, but I'm not a fan of his music, to be honest."],"369":["A: But it can't be true that he didn't have any help, can it?"],"370":["A: But it's not the most popular sport in the world, can it?"],"371":["I don't think it's my best friend's favorite sport, but I would like to learn more about the history of basketball."],"372":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how some things can be so popular, but also the most hated at the same time. It's like the most talked-about topic on social media, but also the most annoying one to listen to."],"373":["I wouldn't know, I don't usually watch music videos on YouTube."],"374":["A: Yeah, I never got into those trends either. My best friend didn't like them either, actually. She's not a fan of pop music. Would you believe she's been listening to the same music since high school?"],"375":["A: But I didn't look like Steve Martin at all, I was just wearing a wig and a fake mustache!"],"376":["I would love to watch more comedy shows like \"The Office\" because it's the funniest TV show ever!"],"377":["A: Yeah, it was a tough competition! I wish I had won, but I'm not disappointed because I had a great time."],"378":["A: I've seen the best movie of the year, it's an action film in Hollywood."],"379":["I've been watching the best movies on Netflix to relax after work."],"380":["A: I would like to see a new Marvel movie, they are my favourite."],"381":["A: But I don't think it's fair that they can use their influence to promote things they don't really care about."],"382":["A: That's a fascinating fact, but I think it's not entirely fair to say that mass media is the sole reason for their influence."],"383":["A: That's a fascinating fact! And it's amazing how quickly things have changed - I mean, I'm not one to complain, but I think it's safe to say that the world has become a much more connected place, and social media has played a huge role in that."],"384":["A: My best friend has a dog and it's really good at sniffing out treats!"],"385":["I think it's amazing that dogs can recognize different languages! My best friend has a dog that can do lots of cool things, like sit and fetch."],"386":["I don't think elephants can use the subway like dogs in Moscow. They are not good at navigating in cities."],"387":["I like LaLa Land!"],"388":["I don't have LaLa Land, it's my best friend's favorite movie."],"389":["A: No, I haven't seen either of them. Would I have liked LaLa Land if I had seen it, I don't know. My best friend said it's amazing, but I'm not sure."],"390":["A: That's really frustrating!"],"391":["I wouldn't be surprised if this is a technical issue, not a problem with the website itself."],"392":["A: That's really frustrating! I've never had this problem before, but I've seen it happen to others too."],"393":["I think it would be great if you had applied for the job at Google, but unfortunately, it's not possible now. If you had gotten the job, I'm sure you would have loved working there."],"394":["I don't like horses, I'm not really into them. But I would love to hear about Andrew Sean Greer's book, it sounds interesting!"],"395":["I'm not really into horses, but I've always loved dogs - I would take my dog for a walk every morning, and it's the best way to start the day."],"396":["A: It can't be a comedy, it's a Star Wars movie!"],"397":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I would never have thought that too, but I guess it's all about personal taste. Do you like sci-fi movies like Star Wars?"],"398":["A: Yeah, it's not my best friend's favorite movie, but I loved it too! I would like to see more movies like that, but not as a comedy, maybe an action movie."],"399":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"400":["I would be really happy if they could do more things like that. It's nice to see them trying to make the games more enjoyable for everyone."],"401":["I would have been really surprised if Benjarvus Green-Ellis had fumbled earlier in his career, but I guess it's not impossible. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have wanted to be known for being perfect either - it's a lot of pressure!"],"402":["I don't think so."],"403":["A: If I had been given that kind of opportunity, I would have taken it in a heartbeat! It's crazy to think that he would have become one of the richest people in the world if he had just taken the 10% stake."],"404":["A: I would love to visit the NBA head office in NY, it would be like a dream come true!"],"405":["That's a great question! According to Guinness World Records, the record for speed reading is held by Howard Berg, who can read 25,000 words per minute."],"406":["I'm not sure, but if I had to guess, I would say it's someone who has a lot of free time!"],"407":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is a huge fan of speed reading and she can read like crazy!"],"408":["I would have loved to see how they did it!"],"409":["A: But it's not the most original idea, is it?"],"410":["I would have loved to see the making of Toy Story, it must have been an incredible experience to work with Steve Jobs, who was a genius like no one else."],"411":["I completely disagree with him on that point. It's not only not supported by scientific evidence, but it's also incredibly irresponsible to spread misinformation like that."],"412":["I don't think it's a good idea to make a disease. It's not fair to people who get sick. My best friend's sister has AIDS, and it's very sad."],"413":["I don't think it's a good idea to make a disease like AIDS. It's not a very effective way to control population growth, and it's caused a lot of suffering and death."],"414":["I wouldn't have rejected the first offer either, I would have taken it!"],"415":["A: Yeah, I think it's crazy how some people can negotiate like that! I mean, I wouldn't have had the guts to reject a deal like that, especially when I was younger. But I guess when you're that talented, you've got to be willing to stand your ground and fight for what you want."],"416":["A: Yeah, I wouldn't have rejected the offer either, especially since it's a huge amount of money! I think it's like he wanted to test the market, you know? And it's not like he's the only one who's good, but he's definitely one of the best, if not the best."],"417":["A: But I don't think I can do that, I'm not really into ancient Greek plays."],"418":["I'd love to give it a try, like I always like trying new things."],"419":["I'm not sure if the website is the best, but I would love to give it a try if it's really that good."],"420":["I would have probably done the same thing if I had known the book existed before watching the film."],"421":["I didn't use to be on Facebook as much as I am now. I used to have a MySpace profile, but I don't have it anymore."],"422":["I'm not as active on social media as I used to be. I would spend hours on MySpace back in the day, but now I'm more focused on other things. It's not the most popular platform anymore, but I still have my profile and occasionally check it out."],"423":["I think it's interesting that you mention Teddy Roosevelt forming his own party. If I were in his shoes, I would have been worried about the future of the country and the impact it would have on the people."],"424":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the history of their political parties, especially how they've evolved over time. It's amazing how they've managed to adapt and change their ideals in response to the needs of their country."],"425":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the history of their political parties, and I would love to know more about the reasons behind their decisions."],"426":["A: That's a great point about the area code. It's amazing how much technology has evolved, and it's even more astonishing to think about what we don't know about the things we use every day. To be honest, it's mind-boggling to consider the secrets that are hidden behind the scenes of our daily lives."],"427":["I think it's scary to think about what kind of technology we might have had if the Cold War had continued. If the Soviet Union had developed their own supercomputer, it would have been a game-changer."],"428":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. My best friend used to play Pok\u00e9mon all the time when we were kids. He would play it every day after school. I never could get into it myself, but he loved it."],"429":["A: Yeah, it's really fascinating! The NBA has the most talented players in the world, and Stephen Curry's family has a rich basketball history, with his brother playing for the Santa Cruz Warriors while he was dominating the court for the Golden State Warriors."],"430":["A: Yeah, it's really amazing! The NBA has the most talented players in the world, and Stephen Curry's brother is one of them!"],"431":["A: Yeah, it's really amazing to see how talented they are! I would love to see them play live, it would be an incredible experience!"],"432":["I think voting for a vice president is my best way."],"433":["I think it's really interesting that you're considering the history of the electoral process. If I were in charge, I would make sure that the voting system is the most efficient and fair one possible. Would you agree that it's essential to have a transparent and accountable system in place?"],"434":["I don't think it's a good idea to vote for a vice president. It's not the best system. In my opinion, it's better to have a president and a vice president elected separately."],"435":["That's really cool! Jorja Smith is an amazing artist, and I'm sure her concert will be incredible to attend."],"436":["A: That's really exciting! Jorja Smith is an amazing artist, and the fact that tickets are so affordable is a huge bonus."],"437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite artist! I wish I could go to the concert with her, but I'm not sure if I can make it. Would you like to go with me if I can get tickets?"],"438":["A: Yeah, I think I would often read about that kind of thing in history books when I was a student."],"439":["A: That's really impressive! I would love to know more about that governor."],"440":["I don't think it's fair to judge Truman's decision without knowing the full context. Would he have done the same if he was in a different situation?"],"441":["A: That's a long one, but I'm sure it's worth watching, as it's the most critically acclaimed film of the year to date."],"442":["A: That's a long one, but I'd love to watch it. I would always have a great time watching Leonardo DiCaprio's movies, he's the most versatile actor I've ever seen."],"443":["A: That's a bit long, but I'd still love to watch it. My best friend has been wanting to see it for ages, so I'll have to convince him to come over. Would you like to join us?"],"444":["I think ice hockey would be the most challenging, but also the most exciting!"],"445":["I don't think I would be good at bandy, it's not my type of sport."],"446":["I would probably choose bandy, as it's the least physically demanding of the three and I'm not very good at running."],"447":["I didn't think so."],"448":["A: It's not very surprising, can you?"],"449":["I wouldn't have thought it was a French movie either, it's not my best friend's favorite genre, but I loved the plot. Would you like to watch another one?"],"450":["No, I didn't vote in the last election."],"451":["I would not like to talk about politics, to be honest."],"452":["A: No, I didn't vote in the last election, but I would have liked to if I had been living in Indonesia."],"453":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the intelligence of dogs, and it's amazing to think that some breeds are more intuitive than others, to recognize and respond to certain colors or sounds."],"454":["A: But wasn't he the poorest of all the presidents in terms of net worth when he was elected?"],"455":["I would love to learn more about those five presidents who were elected while losing the popular vote. It's fascinating to me, like, how politics can be so complex and surprising."],"456":["A: But I don't think it's fair that you need to walk so far to reach a tournament. It's not very accessible for people who can't walk that much."],"457":["I don't think it's getting harder to progress in the game. My best friend is still playing and he's doing just fine."],"458":["I think it's really frustrating that the game gets so much harder as you progress. If I had known how the Pok\u00e9mon would battle, I would have been more willing to play it more often."],"459":["A: Yeah, I used to watch cartoons every day after school, it was a habit, and I would always look forward to it."],"460":["I don't really like horror movies, they're too scary for me."],"461":["A: If I had a choice, I would watch comedy films every day. But, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of slapstick comedy. I think it's because I'm not willing to laugh at something that's not that funny."],"462":["A: Yeah, I've been meaning to rewatch it, I used to watch it every week when it first came out, it was my go-to show."],"463":["A: Yeah, Black Panther is definitely the richest superhero, and his country Wakanda is the most advanced in the world. I don't think Bruce Wayne can even come close to that."],"464":["I would love to watch Black Panther, it's one of my favorite movies!"],"465":["I like watching the NBA, it's really exciting!"],"466":["A: Oh, he's my best shooter!"],"467":["I wouldn't have thought he'd buy so many books if he wasn't a huge fan of children's literature."],"468":["A: That's really interesting about the Canadian radio, I've heard that it's one of the best in the world in terms of diversity of music."],"469":["I don't think so, I don't usually listen to Canadian radio."],"470":["A: That's really interesting about the music in Canada. I don't have much time to listen to the radio, but I would love to hear more about the Canadian rap music. Would you recommend any specific artists or songs?"],"471":["A: No, I don't think so."],"472":["I think if I were James Earl Jones, I would have been really surprised if I knew that my small payment would lead to such a massive fortune."],"473":["A: Ah, yes! Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney for a whopping $4.06 billion! Can you believe it? It's the biggest deal in the history of the film industry!"],"474":["I would love to visit that secret room! It must be so cool to see all the behind-the-scenes stuff."],"475":["I would love to visit that secret room! If I had the chance, I would be willing to do anything to get there."],"476":["A: I don't think I can visit the secret room, it's not possible for me. But my best friend can, she's a big fan of Pixar! Would you like to go with us if we ever get the chance?"],"477":["That's a great recommendation, I'm really looking forward to watching it, as it's supposed to be the most intense boxing movie ever to be made."],"478":["I would love to watch it, because I like movies with strong characters like Rocky."],"479":["I'm not a big fan of action movies, but I would love to watch this one because it has such an amazing cast."],"480":["A: That's a great idea! It would be the most remote and exclusive internet connection in the world, a true marvel of modern technology!"],"481":["I would have loved to have a satellite dish installed on the roof of the guest house, so we could have internet connection even at the top of the world!"],"482":["I would love to have a guest house on the moon, it would be my best adventure ever!"],"483":["I don't think that's a good idea, is it?"],"484":["That's crazy! I think it's my best friend's worst idea ever!"],"485":["That's crazy! I would never do that, not in a million years!"],"486":["I would have loved to read his books if I had known about them back then."],"487":["A: But I don't think his books are the best to read."],"488":["I think it's really interesting that you mention Allie's mom being rude. If I were in that situation, I would be really upset."],"489":["I like painting, but I would rather take a photo."],"490":["I don't think I can paint. I'm not very good at it, and I don't have the time."],"491":["I'm not really good at painting, but I would love to learn. I've never had the time to take a class, though."],"492":["A: That's my best friend's favorite player!"],"493":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't practice it, though."],"494":["I would rather not practice it because I don't like the way it looks, to be honest."],"495":["I would have been surprised if George Lucas's wife had won an Oscar before him, but I guess that's just the way it turned out."],"496":["I wish I knew who won the most Oscars this year! I would love to know that!"],"497":["I don't think George Lucas's wife is the most famous person to have won an Oscar. Can you tell me who won the most Oscars this year?"],"498":["I'm not a huge fan of Gwyneth Paltrow's acting, but I think she fits well in the role of Pepper Potts."],"499":["I don't like the Iron Man movies as much as Spider-Man."],"500":["I wouldn't say Iron Man is the best superhero movie, but it's definitely one of the most iconic ones. I would like to watch SpiderMan again, it's my favorite superhero movie, and I think it's the best one."],"501":["A: It's amazing to think that the most expensive World Cup in history will be held in Qatar, which is still being built, and yet it's going to cost the country a fortune to host it!"],"502":["A: That's amazing! I've always thought that hosting the World Cup is a huge financial burden, not to mention the environmental impact."],"503":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see Jon Stewart play. But, to be honest, I don't think I would have been able to watch it, as I wasn't even born yet. If I had been older, I would have definitely watched it."],"504":["A: Ah, sorry about that! It was actually the most hilarious comedy I've ever seen, and it starred Jason Momoa, Chris Hemsworth, and Emma Stone, all of whom were absolutely fantastic in their roles."],"505":["A: No, it wasn't Jason Momoa, and to be honest, I'm not really a fan of his shirtless scenes. I would like to see a movie with a more subtle sense of humor, like a witty dialogue or clever plot twist."],"506":["A: Honestly, I'm not sure, but I think it was one of the most hilarious comedies I've ever seen, and I would always laugh out loud every time I watched it."],"507":["I wouldn't have expected the film to be so funny, but I guess that's just the way it was. I mean, I've seen Tom Hanks in other movies, and he usually plays more serious roles, but I suppose that's what made this one stand out."],"508":["I wouldn't have liked it if it was all serious, to be honest. I think it's better when there's a bit of balance, you know?"],"509":["I didn't think the film was the funniest I've ever seen, but it was definitely entertaining. Would you agree that it's one of the most overrated movies of all time?"],"510":["I don't think that's true. Can't they still get sponsorships and recognition even if they don't win?"],"511":["I think it's sad that Olympians who don't win may never get to shine in the spotlight or make money from their endeavors. If I were an Olympian, I would be willing to train hard and give it my best shot, even if I didn't win."],"512":["I'm not sure I agree with that, B. If I were an Olympian who didn't win, I wouldn't be sad because I would still have the experience and the knowledge that I gave it my best shot."],"513":["I think Dr. Nefario was really funny, don't you like him?"],"514":["I don't think so. He was actually quite annoying to work with."],"515":["A: Yeah, Dr. Nefario was the most brilliant scientist in the whole movie, and he would always come up with crazy inventions. But, to be honest, I didn't really like him that much."],"516":["A: Isn't it true that The Social Network won several Academy Awards?"],"517":["I don't think it's a very good movie, to be honest."],"518":["A: Oh, it's not my best friend's favorite movie, but I really enjoyed it!"],"519":["I don't think that's a fair comparison, though. Just because an umpire doesn't have the luxury of time to deliberate doesn't mean they can't make informed decisions."],"520":["I think it's unfair that an umpire has to make a decision in a split second, without being able to deliberate or consult with others, whereas a judge has the luxury of taking their time to consider all the evidence."],"521":["I completely agree with you, B. It's not like I would want to be in their shoes, having to make such tough decisions."],"522":["I would have been shocked if I had been a user of Google's services on that day. Can you imagine the chaos if the internet was down for that long?"],"523":["A: That's crazy! I think it's my best friend's worst nightmare if Google went down for even a minute, let alone five!"],"524":["I think it's fascinating to learn about the company's unique approach to lawn maintenance. I would love to see how they manage their goats and ensure their well-being."],"525":["A: Ah, no, it's more about the most effective strategies in sales, not just about selling stocks, but also about building strong relationships with clients and understanding their needs."],"526":["A: No, not at all! He doesn't teach that. He's more focused on corporate sales and business development."],"527":["A: That's correct! He's an expert in teaching people how to sell penny stocks and other financial products. He's actually one of the best in the industry, to be honest. Would you like to attend one of his seminars?"],"528":["A: It's not about a zoo, then? Can you do a movie about animals talking?"],"529":["A: If I had known that, I wouldn't have guessed it was about animals living together in harmony. Would you have recommended it to me if I had asked you about it?"],"530":["A: I wouldn't have guessed that! It's not the kind of movie I usually watch, but I've heard it's the funniest animated film of all time. Can you tell me more about it?"],"531":["A: That's really disappointing to hear, I hope it's not a sign of the company's financial struggles, which would be a huge setback for the industry's most innovative company to date."],"532":["A: Yeah, I hope not too, I would like to see the company succeed and keep growing, my best friend has a Tesla and he loves it."],"533":["I don't think it's possible that Elon Musk would send an email about layoffs, it can't be true. Would you like to know what he actually said in the email?"],"534":["I think it would be interesting to see how the team would have performed if they had won those three games. Would they have made it to the playoffs?"],"535":["A: But my best friend is a huge fan of the Saints, and she's not bothered by it. She thinks it's just a silly rule."],"536":["I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they have such strict rules for the cheerleaders, but not for the players. It would be amazing to see women play in the NFL, and I wish they would be given a fair chance to prove themselves."],"537":["A: That's a good point, I've heard that the panda costumes can get really smelly after a long day at the research centre, it's probably the most disgusting thing to wear in the world!"],"538":["I don't think I would want to wear a panda costume all day, it would be too hot and uncomfortable."],"539":["A: Ah, that's a good point, but I'm not sure I'd want to wear a panda costume all day, it would be really hot and uncomfortable! My best friend actually wore a panda costume to a party once and it was a disaster, she said it was the most uncomfortable thing she's ever worn."],"540":["That's so true! Facebook is really my best friend, I mean, it's so popular and everyone uses it."],"541":["I don't think it's true that anyone can sign up for Facebook if they're at least 13 years old. Wouldn't they have to verify their age somehow?"],"542":["I don't think it's a good idea to let anyone sign up for Facebook, regardless of their age. It's not safe for kids, and it's not fair to the parents who are trying to protect them. My best friend's little sister is only 8 years old, and she's already asking to join Facebook! It's crazy. Would you like to know what I think? I think Facebook should have stricter rules about who can join."],"543":["I would like to see Forrest Gump too!"],"544":["I've never seen Forrest Gump, but I've heard it's the most popular movie of all time in the United States."],"545":["I'm not a big fan of Forrest Gump, to be honest."],"546":["A: No, I haven't read Andersen's original."],"547":["A: Yeah, I've read it, and it's actually even more magical than the movie!"],"548":["A: No, I haven't read Andersen's original, but I would like to see it, it's probably the most beautiful fairy tale ever written."],"549":["I know, right? I wish I had known what it was about before watching it. I would have avoided it!"],"550":["A: That's hilarious! I'm surprised they didn't realize it was going to be a horror film, especially considering the subject matter. I mean, it's not exactly a light-hearted topic. Did they really think a romance between a little girl and Satan would be a crowd-pleaser?"],"551":["A: I know, right? The Exorcist is still considered one of the most terrifying films of all time, and it's crazy to think that the people involved in its production didn't realize it would be a horror movie. I mean, it's not like they were trying to make a light-hearted comedy or anything!"],"552":["I don't think ET would have been a good horror movie, can you imagine?"],"553":["I think it's interesting that you mention Hitchcock's movies being more suspenseful than horror. If I had to choose between the two, I would say that I prefer suspenseful movies too."],"554":["A: That's really interesting! I would often watch ET as a kid, it's still one of my favorite childhood movies. I think it's because it's a heartwarming story and not too scary, unlike some of the other movies that Hitchcock made, like Psycho, which is still the most suspenseful film I've ever seen."],"555":["A: Yeah, I think we're supposed to talk about a movie. I would like to watch a comedy, like \"The Hangover\" or something."],"556":["A: I think we're supposed to discuss the most popular movie of the year, which would be a great topic to explore."],"557":["A: No, we're not supposed to bring a movie. We're going to talk about the most interesting places to visit in Paris in the world."],"558":["A: But aren't dogs actually more social than elephants?"],"559":["A: That's true, elephants are really intelligent animals. In fact, they have the largest brain of any land animal, and they're known for their excellent memory. Would you believe that they have been known to remember and recognize their family members even after many years of separation?"],"560":["A: I don't think I could ever have a pet elephant, it's just too big! My best friend has a dog and it's really cute, but I don't think I could take care of an elephant. Would you like to see a video of my friend's dog?"],"561":["A: That's my best movie!"],"562":["A: I know, he's been doing that kind of role really well, hasn't he? He's been playing the most complex characters to perfection, and I would always look forward to his movies."],"563":["A: Yeah, I know, he's always been a great actor. He's played some really tough roles, like in Inception, where he was the most convincing dream thief ever."],"564":["A: That's fascinating! Dogs are probably the most intelligent animals to be kept as pets, to be honest."],"565":["I think if I had a dog, I would name it something clever like Max or Luna."],"566":["I'm not sure I agree with Google's preference, though - I think cats are way more independent and low-maintenance, and they're not as needy as dogs can be."],"567":["I'm not surprised, actually. It's not just shoes, though - dogs seem to have a thing for chewing on anything they can get their teeth into!"],"568":["I don't like it when dogs chew on shoes."],"569":["I think it's because dogs are naturally curious and love to explore their surroundings, so they tend to chew on anything they can get their teeth on, including shoes."],"570":["I would like the part when Officer Judy is back on the farm with her parents and she finds out what she has not been a person but a plant."],"571":["I would have liked it if the movie had a happier ending, but I still enjoyed it."],"572":["I would have loved the part when the main character discovers the truth about his identity, it was so intense!"],"573":["I would love to hear one of those albums!"],"574":["I don't think that's possible."],"575":["I would never imagine that!"],"576":["A: I would like to see the movie, it sounds interesting."],"577":["A: That's really interesting! I would like to see the most evil villain's story told like that."],"578":["A: That's really interesting! I wouldn't have thought that the bad lady, I mean, Maleficent, would be the main character. It's not the most positive movie, but I would like to see it because it's not like any other Sleeping Beauty story I've seen before."],"579":["I would have loved to have been a student of his, if I had gone to that high school."],"580":["That's really interesting! I would have loved to attend a class with him, I think he must have been an amazing teacher."],"581":["I would have loved to have been one of his students! Can you imagine how inspiring it must have been to learn from him?"],"582":["I would love to visit the museums and theaters too!"],"583":["A: Oh, that's my best friend's favorite museum! He's a huge history buff."],"584":["I've never been to Washington D.C. either, but I've heard it's an amazing city. I would love to visit the National Mall and see the iconic landmarks like the White House and the Capitol Building."],"585":["A: It's not a good movie, can't you see?"],"586":["A: That's my favourite movie!"],"587":["I don't think Zootopia is the best movie ever, but it's still really good."],"588":["I don't think the first President of Zimbabwe was a singer."],"589":["A: That's a really interesting question! I would love to know more about the first President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, and his music career."],"590":["A: I don't think that's a good idea, not at all! I would like it if the runner-up in the presidential election could choose whether they want to be the vice president or not."],"591":["A: But they can't crush themselves, can they?"],"592":["I would love to learn more about sharks!"],"593":["I wouldn't have thought that sharks evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees, but I guess it's true!"],"594":["A: Ah, yes! It's the most popular online streaming service in the world, with over 220 million subscribers in over 190 countries."],"595":["I don't think so. I've never been interested in knowing how it was founded."],"596":["A: Actually, I'm not a huge fan of binge-watching, but I'd love to learn more about its history. What's the most interesting thing you've learned about Netflix's founding?"],"597":["That's amazing! It's incredible to think that the team that avoided scoring a touchdown in the Super Bowl was the New York Giants, and it happened in Super Bowl 46. It's like the universe was setting up a dramatic scene!"],"598":["That's amazing! The New York Giants' decision to avoid scoring a touchdown in Super Bowl 46 is definitely one of the most bizarre moments in NFL history. It's crazy to think that they could have won the game if they had just gone for it."],"599":["That's amazing! I've been to many stadiums, but my best friend's favorite is still the Jacksonville stadium. I would always go there with him every year."],"600":["A: If I were you, I would love to know more about the rights that animals have in Germany. Would you like to find out what they are?"],"601":["A: That's really cool! But do you think it's true that hiccups are from evolution? I've never thought about it before. My best friend is actually a zoologist and she says it's not that simple."],"602":["I'm not sure if it's true, but I think it's interesting to imagine what would happen if animals had the same rights as humans. Can you imagine if animals could vote in elections?"],"603":["I would have loved to play the NES, it was an amazing console!"],"604":["A: Yeah, I did, I was actually really into it, but I wasn't as good as my friends, they would play for hours on end, not that I didn't enjoy it, but I just didn't have the time, I was always busy with school and stuff."],"605":["A: No way, I didn't play the NES, but my best friend was obsessed with it, he would play it all the time when we were kids."],"606":["A: Yeah, it has some of the most talented actors in Hollywood in it, including the most famous actress in the world right now."],"607":["I would like to see it, I've heard it's really good."],"608":["A: Actually, it's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen, and I would always look forward to watching it again."],"609":["I would have thought that if I had been a soldier back then, I would have loved to have had a convenient way to get food without leaving my car."],"610":["A: Yeah, it's really interesting. I would often hear about it from my dad, who used to work at McDonald's back in the day. He would tell me stories about how they would accommodate those soldiers, and it's amazing how it became a standard feature."],"611":["A: Yeah, that's really cool! I would love to have a classic car like that. Do you think it would be fun to drive one like that?"],"612":["A: I'm feeling my best today, thanks!"],"613":["A: If I had won the lottery, I would buy a house on the beach."],"614":["A: I would like to go to the beach today, it's the most beautiful place to relax."],"615":["I think it's interesting to imagine how things would be different if that rule was still in place today. If a presidential candidate's running mate had to become president if they won the election, I wonder if it would have changed the outcome of some elections."],"616":["I would have thought that the system would be more democratic, but it's not like it's a habit of the past to change it suddenly."],"617":["That's really interesting! I had no idea that the runner-up in a presidential election used to become president until 1805. I wonder what would happen if that rule was still in place today - it would be a very different political landscape!"],"618":["I don't think it's true that dogs are not really color blind. I've always thought they were."],"619":["I don't think it's true that dogs are not color blind. Can you show me the information you found? I would like to know more about it."],"620":["A: That's amazing! I would love to learn more about that! My best friend has a dog that's a therapy dog, and I've seen how much joy it brings to people."],"621":["I would have watched it with my friends all the time when I was in college."],"622":["A: I would like to watch it too, because I like Gerard Butler's voice."],"623":["A: Yeah, Gerard Butler's voice is really deep and soothing, don't you think? I've always loved his movies, and this one is definitely one of my best friends' favorites too."],"624":["I don't usually use Spotify, I prefer to listen to the radio."],"625":["I don't usually use Spotify, but I would like to try it out. Do you think it's better than Pandora?"],"626":["I'm surprised you're not obsessed with Spotify, considering it's the most popular music streaming service! Would I like it more than Pandora? Honestly, I think it's the best option for discovering new music."],"627":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how some people can be so reckless with other people's feelings, and it's even more surprising when they're willing to give up a huge sum of money, like Russell did, which is really admirable in a weird way."],"628":["A: Yeah, I think he's a pretty unusual guy, and I would be really impressed if he's willing to give up that much money, it's the most generous thing he could have done in that situation."],"629":["I think it's ridiculous that he would even consider marrying someone for 20 million dollars. He's a famous person, he can't be that desperate."],"630":["I liked it!"],"631":["I didn't like it."],"632":["I thought it was the most amazing film I've ever seen, but I would have liked it even more if it had a happier ending."],"633":["I used to watch a lot of documentaries about the Thermysciran coast when I was a kid, so I'm pretty sure it's not a real place."],"634":["I think the \"Thermysciran coast\" is one of the most beautiful places in the movie, and I would love to visit it in real life."],"635":["I think it's unlikely that the director would make a movie about a place that doesn't exist, but if he did, I would be really excited to see it."],"636":["I think it's unlikely that they would have invested correctly, but if they had, they would have been set for life."],"637":["I don't think Tim Duncan is the highest-paid player in the NBA, but he's definitely one of the most successful ones."],"638":["I think it's quite astonishing that some players, like Iverson, can secure contracts that guarantee them a tremendous amount of money for life. If they manage their finances wisely, they should be able to live comfortably without worrying about money."],"639":["I would love to hear more about Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing!"],"640":["A: If I were a musician, I would have loved to see Eddie Van Halen's recording session, it would have been incredible!"],"641":["A: I know, right? It's crazy what some musicians will do to get a unique sound! I wouldn't want to be the one cleaning up the mess after Eddie Van Halen's studio fire, though!"],"642":["A: To be honest, I'm surprised they're not doing better, considering they have LeBron and a strong supporting cast. They're definitely capable of being the best team in the league, but it seems like they're struggling to find their rhythm this season."],"643":["I think they would be doing much better if they had kept their best player, Anthony Davis. If they had, they would be my best team in the league right now."],"644":["A: Oh, I don't think they're doing well this year. They're not my best friend, the Lakers. I would like them to do better, but they can't."],"645":["That's incredible! It's amazing to think that the game went on for so long, taking up over 31 hours to complete."],"646":["A: Actually, I wouldn't want to sit through that either, not for 31 innings! It's not the most enjoyable experience, to say the least."],"647":["I would not want to sit through that either! It's crazy to think about playing for 31 innings, that's like, the longest game ever!"],"648":["I know, it's crazy how Mark Zuckerberg's ability to adapt and improve his ideas is unparalleled!"],"649":["I think it's fascinating how the film portrays the Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's lawsuits against Zuckerberg, revealing the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's attitude, which would make him highly unsympathetic to a jury."],"650":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how Mark Zuckerberg became so successful, my best friend! He's really good at making money. But, to be honest, I don't think he's a good person. He's not very nice, and he doesn't care about others. I don't think he can be a good friend. Would you like to know more about his story?"],"651":["A: That's correct! Reed Hastings was indeed inspired to create Netflix after being charged a $40 late fee on a DVD rental, which led him to think about a subscription-based service that would allow customers to keep DVDs as long as they wanted without incurring late fees, making it the most convenient way to watch movies at home."],"652":["A: Ah, yes, that's true! Reed Hastings was actually one of the most frustrated customers, having to pay a $40 late fee on a DVD, which motivated him to create a service that would allow people to rent DVDs by mail without late fees."],"653":["A: That's really interesting! I think it's the best movie streaming site in the world, I would love to know more about its history."],"654":["A: Yeah, I've heard that before. I used to listen to the radio a lot when I was younger, and I'd often notice that they'd play a lot of Canadian artists."],"655":["I don't think so... I don't really like that idea."],"656":["A: That's really interesting! I didn't know that. My best friend is a huge music lover, and she would love to know that. Would she like to start a radio station in Canada, I think she would be really excited!"],"657":["I don't think I've ever read the terms of purchase either."],"658":["That's so true! I'm one of the biggest procrastinators when it comes to reading terms and conditions. I wish I had the discipline to be one of the 7 percent who actually read them, but I'd rather spend my time doing something more enjoyable, like watching cat videos online, which is probably the most entertaining thing to do on the internet, don't you think?"],"659":["A: That's crazy! I wish I didn't have to read them, but I think it's good to know what you're getting into. Do you think it's like a big responsibility to be aware of what you're signing up for?"],"660":["I don't think so."],"661":["A: Yeah, I know! He's the most creative person to ever live, isn't he? I wish I could be as innovative as him."],"662":["I don't think it's a good idea. I like the cowboy doll, it's my best friend."],"663":["A: But you shouldn't have blown it out, now it's even more broken!"],"664":["A: That's not the best idea, my best friend!"],"665":["A: That's the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced! I would hate to have to deal with a keyboard like that again."],"666":["I would love to watch 3rd Rock again, it was like my favorite show!"],"667":["A: No, I don't do that. I can't watch TV every day. But I love watching old TV shows in my free time."],"668":["I didn't really watch TV regularly, but I would always watch 3rd rock when it was on. It was the funniest show I had ever seen."],"669":["A: Actually, I don't watch TV that much, I'm more of a movie person myself."],"670":["I would have thought that Walt Disney would still hold the record, but I guess I was wrong! If I had known that Eminem had more Oscars than all those other famous people combined, I would have been surprised."],"671":["I would have thought that Walt Disney would still hold the record, but I guess I was wrong! If I had known that Eminem had more Oscars than all those other famous people combined, I would have been surprised."],"672":["I would like to see it because I like Disney movies."],"673":["I don't really like scary movies, but I would like to see this one because it's Disney."],"674":["I'm not really familiar with the plot of the Snow Queen, but I've heard it's the most romantic Disney movie to date. Would you like to watch it with me and find out?"],"675":["I think it's MY BEST FRIEND's worst nightmare to be attacked by a shark!"],"676":["I think it's really sad when sharks are tortured for their fins. My best friend's brother was a marine biologist and he loved sharks. He would always say that sharks are amazing creatures and we should respect their place in the ocean."],"677":["I think it's really sad that so many sharks are being killed for their fins. It's not only cruel, but also unnecessary. We can easily find alternative sources of food."],"678":["A: But I don't think we can stop cutting down the forests. Can't we do something to save them?"],"679":["I'm not sure we'll ever stop cutting down the forests, it's a shame."],"680":["A: I don't think we can stop cutting down the forests, it's not possible. My best friend is a botanist and she says it's the most important thing we can do to save the planet. Would you like to join us in planting some trees this weekend?"],"681":["A: That's my worst day ever!"],"682":["I don't like sad scenes."],"683":["I think it's my best friend's worst day ever. He can't even be happy."],"684":["A: That's my best friend's brother who's a mechanic, he's always talking about YouTube and how it's the most useful thing for fixing cars."],"685":["A: I don't think I would watch business and entrepreneur videos, I'm not really interested in that. But I like the idea of finding useful tutorials online, like how to fix things."],"686":["A: I'm not sure I agree with you, to be honest. I think most of the content on YouTube is useless and a waste of time. Would you still use YouTube if it wasn't free?"],"687":["I don't think so. He was only 18 and already had a lot of potential, but he didn't sign with either of them."],"688":["I think he was very smart to prioritize his own goals and values, and not just chase after the highest-paying offer."],"689":["I think he was very confident in his abilities, even back then. He would always be very picky about the brands he worked with, and he wouldn't settle for anything less than the best."],"690":["A: But isn't it surprising that a show like The Simpsons, which is primarily a comedy, has such a huge audience?"],"691":["A: But wouldn't it be great if they had a channel that was just about comedy, not just news? I mean, I'm not saying it would be a huge success, but it would be a nice change from the usual serious stuff."],"692":["A: I don't think it's a good idea to have a channel only about The Simpsons. It's my best friend's favorite show, but even they can't watch it all day. Would you like to watch a channel with only one show? I wouldn't, it would get boring."],"693":["A: It's actually the most emotional part of the movie, in the scene where the main character says goodbye to his family."],"694":["A: Ah, it's actually the most intense and dramatic part of the movie, where the main character faces the biggest challenge of his life. I would say it's the most emotional and suspenseful part of the film, and it really gets to you."],"695":["I'm not a big fan of drama movies, to be honest, but I would like to see this one because it's supposed to be the most critically acclaimed film of the year."],"696":["A: It's not a well-known director, but I think it's directed by Bennett Miller."],"697":["A: It's not the most popular movie, but it's directed by Bennett Miller."],"698":["A: It's not the best movie, but it's still quite entertaining."],"699":["A: I would often hear my parents talking about how they used to rely on newspapers and phone booths to stay informed, and now it's hard to imagine a time without Google and smartphones."],"700":["I think it's interesting that you mention autonomous cars. I would love to see how it would change our daily lives."],"701":["I think it's interesting that we're always looking for the next big thing, but sometimes I wonder if we're just getting too reliant on technology."],"702":["I'm surprised that people still use Netflix's DVD rental service, considering they can stream movies and TV shows instantly."],"703":["I don't think it's surprising that people are still renting DVDs through the mail, actually. Would they still be doing it if Blockbuster was still around?"],"704":["A: That's really surprising! I would have thought they'd spend more on bandwidth, considering how many people are streaming their content. But I guess it just goes to show how popular their DVD rental service still is."],"705":["I don't have a preference for movies of historical or political genre."],"706":["I would love to watch movies of historical genre, they are my favorite!"],"707":["I don't like movies of historical, political genre. My best friend likes them, but I prefer watching comedies. Would you like to watch a funny movie with me?"],"708":["A: That's true, and it's surprising that none of the richest presidents in history have been from the last few decades, to be honest."],"709":["A: Yeah, and I think my best friend is the smartest person I know."],"710":["I'm surprised that none of the recent presidents have been as wealthy as those three."],"711":["A: That's really interesting. Is he the closest to his new mother in the whole family?"],"712":["A: Actually, he doesn't really call her \"mom\" to be honest, he's not that close to her."],"713":["I think he wouldn't call her \"mom\" at all, actually. He's very stubborn and would always refer to his biological mother as \"MY BEST FRIEND\" and never acknowledge the new one as his mother."],"714":["A: That's my best friend's favorite team!"],"715":["A: That's amazing! My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he's always talking about the NBA."],"716":["I didn't think it was possible to have a basketball court in the U.S. supreme court building, but I guess it's true! It's really surprising, isn't it?"],"717":["I don't think it is just about retelling the original story."],"718":["A: Yeah, exactly! I would love to watch it with you, it's a really good movie."],"719":["I'm not a huge fan of reboots, but I have to admit that Batman Begins is actually one of the best superhero origin stories I've ever seen. It's not just a rehashing of the same old tale, but a really well-crafted exploration of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. Would you believe that Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne is actually one of the most intense and nuanced I've ever seen?"],"720":["A: That's incredible! But I think it's not just luck that led to their success."],"721":["A: Yeah, it's incredible! I mean, who would have thought that a company that was once on the verge of bankruptcy would become the most popular streaming service in the world, with the largest subscriber base and the highest revenue?"],"722":["A: That's incredible! I would love to be a part of the team that made that decision. It's amazing how one wrong move can lead to such a huge difference."],"723":["A: Honestly, I think the film's portrayal of diversity is somewhat lacking, with hardly any representation of people of color or minority groups, which is quite disappointing considering the epic scale of the story."],"724":["A: No, there aren't any Jews in it, but I think it's one of the most intense war movies I've ever seen, with some of the most incredible action sequences to date."],"725":["A: Honestly, I'm not sure if there are any Jews in it, but I would imagine that Christopher Nolan would have included some diverse characters in his film, given his willingness to tackle complex and thought-provoking themes."],"726":["I would have been really worried if I were in their shoes."],"727":["That's a really scary story! I would have been terrified if I were in their shoes."],"728":["I don't think it's true that the parents didn't know he was missing until they were halfway to Paris. It's not the most unbelievable thing I've ever heard, but it's still quite surprising."],"729":["A: He is the WORST teacher in the movie!"],"730":["I don't think he was a scam in the movie."],"731":["A: I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in the movie is absolutely outstanding to act, he really brings the character to life! Would you agree with me on that?"],"732":["I think it's interesting that you mention floppy disks. If I were in charge of the White House back then, I would have upgraded to newer technology a long time ago!"],"733":["A: Yeah, I know, right? But, isn't it amazing that Teddy was my best friend of all presidents when it comes to conservation?"],"734":["I think it's crazy how some people still use floppy disks! They're so outdated, it's like they're stuck in the past."],"735":["I haven't read the Harry Potter books, but I've seen the movies."],"736":["A: Actually, I'm not a huge fan of fantasy movies, but I've heard it's the most popular franchise in the world, with the highest-grossing film in the series being the last one, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald."],"737":["A: That's really interesting! I've never been a huge fan of fantasy movies, but I've heard Fantastic Beasts is the best one out of all the Harry Potter spin-offs. Would you like to watch it with me sometime?"],"738":["A: That's so cool! I've heard that K-pop idols are known for their exceptional teamwork and camaraderie, which is often reflected in their choreographed dance moves and harmonious vocals."],"739":["I wouldn't know, but I'd love to find out!"],"740":["I'm not sure what they would compliment each other about, but I think the K-pop industry is the most successful one in the world to produce. Would you like to know why?"],"741":["I completely disagree with the idea that some people are too stubborn. In fact, I think it's not just a matter of being stubborn, but rather a lack of understanding about the benefits of renewable energy and the consequences of not taking action."],"742":["I completely agree with you. My best friend is very passionate about environmental issues and always says that we should be more like Jimmy Carter, who was a true leader in this area. Would you like to join us for a volunteer day at the local park to help clean up the trails?"],"743":["I completely agree with you, it's essential to prioritize renewable energy and put aside our differences to achieve significant progress."],"744":["I think it would be hilarious if we could find a video of him dancing ballet, it would be a great way to show people that even tough guys can have a softer side."],"745":["I don't think it's possible to find a YouTube video of him dancing ballet, but it would be amazing to see it!"],"746":["I think it's unlikely that there's a video of Tupac dancing ballet, but it would be amazing to see it! If I were him, I would have been so embarrassed if my friends teased me about it."],"747":["I think the special effects are the most impressive part of the movie to watch."],"748":["I would have thought that the special effects would be the most impressive part, but actually, the stunts were mind-blowing."],"749":["I think the action scenes are the most exciting part of the film, and I would love to see more of them."],"750":["A: That's really cool! I think McDonald's is the best fast food chain in the world."],"751":["A: I would like to have a hat like that too!"],"752":["I don't think it was McDonald's who created the drive-thru. My best friend's dad is from Detroit and he says it was actually a restaurant in Oklahoma that invented it. I would love to try it out, but I don't think I would like it as much as a cat in the hat style hat!"],"753":["I used to read a lot when I was younger, but nowadays I don't have as much time as I'd like."],"754":["A: Yeah, I'm not a big reader, my best friend is actually a bookworm, but I can do it sometimes, can you imagine if we didn't have internet, we wouldn't be able to access all those books, it's crazy!"],"755":["Here's a possible next turn for A:\n\n\"I'm not a big fan of reading, to be honest. I mean, I've tried to read books before, but I never have the time to finish them. If I had more time, I would love to read more. But with the internet, I can just look up summaries and articles instead. It's not the same, but it's better than nothing. Have you ever tried reading a book that was banned or censored? That's really interesting to me, and I would love to learn more about it.\""],"756":["A: Yeah, it's definitely a popular sport, especially during March Madness, which is the most intense period in the basketball calendar, with the most thrilling games and the highest stakes."],"757":["I think it's crazy that men would do that, but if I were them, I wouldn't want to miss the games either."],"758":["A: But wouldn't it be amazing if the sequel was even better than the first one?"],"759":["A: Yeah, I'm a huge fan of listening to the radio while I'm driving, it's the best way to get through rush hour traffic!"],"760":["I'm not really into listening to the radio, to be honest. Would you like to listen to some music instead?"],"761":["I don't usually listen to the radio, but I wish I could because I love listening to music."],"762":["A: But it's not possible, can't be, that bowlers were paid more than football players in the past."],"763":["I don't think that would have been a good idea, wearing helmets while bowling. It would have looked silly!"],"764":["A: Yeah, that game was crazy! I wouldn't have wanted to be a Cumberland fan that day, that would have been a really tough loss to take."],"765":["I would like to know more about the zebrafish and their secrets to disease-free immortality."],"766":["A: Wouldn't it be incredible if scientists could unlock the secrets of the zebrafish's longevity and apply it to humans?"],"767":["A: But I don't think we'll ever find a way to live forever, like my best friend loves playing video games, but even the best gamers can't play forever!"],"768":["A: That's not true, can't be true, because I've seen pictures of Icelandic horses in other countries."],"769":["I don't think Clint Eastwood was allergic to horses when he was filming The Unforgiven."],"770":["I don't think it's true that an Icelandic horse can never return to Iceland. Would I like to know the reason behind this rule, like why it's so important to keep them there?"],"771":["I don't think Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band."],"772":["A: Yeah, I used to watch Frozen with my sister all the time when I was a kid."],"773":["A: Yeah, I've seen Frozen, it's one of the best Disney movies ever! But I didn't like it as much as I would have liked to, because I'm not a big fan of musicals."],"774":["A: That's my best movie, I loved how it showed Gru's funny side!"],"775":["A: That's a great point, I think it's one of the most interesting aspects of the film, actually. It's not often that you see a villain like Gru being portrayed in such a way, and it really makes the movie stand out."],"776":["I completely agree, it's not often that you see a villain like Gru being portrayed in such a way. If I had to choose, I think that scene was the most crucial part of the film to make him a more likable character."],"777":["I don't think Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people."],"778":["I would love to have a wardrobe full of the most comfortable clothes, like the softest t-shirts and the warmest sweaters."],"779":["I think it's amazing that Steve Smith is so committed to his cause, and I would be willing to do the same if I were in his shoes."],"780":["I would like to watch it!"],"781":["A: But Marvel Studio isn't the most successful one in terms of box office revenue."],"782":["A: I would love to see the most exciting Marvel movie in the cinema."],"783":["I didn't own a NES or a SNES, but I've played some of the classic games on emulators."],"784":["I'm not a big fan of Kung Fu Hustle either, but I do think it's a hilarious movie. I'd love to see a comedy that's even more ridiculous and over-the-top than Kung Pow: Enter the Fist."],"785":["I'm not a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle, to be honest. I think it's not as funny as some other movies out there. I would rather watch something like The Hangover, which is just hilarious."],"786":["I don't think that's true, Facebook isn't mostly blue because of Zuckerberg's colorblindness."],"787":["A: That's a crazy promotion! If I had won, I would have definitely taken advantage of it."],"788":["A: That's really interesting about Facebook's color scheme! But I don't think I'd like to unfriend 10 people just for a free Whopper, that's a bit extreme, isn't it?"],"789":["That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by the ingenuity of soldiers to create such radios under such harsh conditions."],"790":["I would like to learn Latin, it's a very interesting language."],"791":["I would love to learn more about those radios!"],"792":["I would love to hear more about those classic radio dramas!"],"793":["That's amazing! I've always loved listening to the radio, it's my best hobby! I would listen to it every day when I was younger, and I still do!"],"794":["I would love to learn more about those radio dramas you mentioned! Can you tell me more about the website and what kind of dramas they have?"],"795":["I don't have it, I never had it, I don't have a Nintendo system."],"796":["A: Like me! I'm not really into video games, I prefer watching movies."],"797":["A: Yeah, it's really scary when you think about it. I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I have to trust someone completely, because you never know who can be the most untrustworthy person. Would you like to play some games together sometime?"],"798":["A: I know, right? I used to think that too, but I would often watch documentaries about the NFL and MLB, and I would always be surprised by the facts I would learn."],"799":["I would like to know more about that. It's interesting to see how technology is used in sports. I wish I could attend a game and see it in action."],"800":["I'm not surprised that engineers earn more than NFL and MLB players. If I had known that, I wouldn't have been surprised by the statistic."],"801":["But isn't it surprising that Idaho has no protected areas for wolves, considering their importance in the ecosystem?"],"802":["I wouldn't like to live in a place with no protected areas for wolves, it's not a good idea."],"803":["That's really sad to hear about the wolves in Idaho. It's the worst that they don't have any protected areas, and it's not surprising that their numbers are so low."],"804":["I like that too! I wish I could have a job at Google, it would be so cool to work with such a big company."],"805":["A: Actually, I haven't, but I'm not sure I'd want to, as it's probably not the most efficient use of my time!"],"806":["A: Yeah, I have! I used to do it all the time when I was a kid. My best friend and I would spend hours playing with Google's Easter eggs."],"807":["A: Yeah, it was a big blow to the team when he got hurt. He was always a consistent performer and would always show up to play every week."],"808":["A: But I don't think it will happen. He can't end his career because he's a strong player."],"809":["A: Yeah, it was a huge blow to the team, and it's been tough to recover from that. They've had to rely on other players to step up, but no one's been able to fill the void left by Smith's absence."],"810":["I used to watch a lot of movies back in my university days, but I haven't had much time for it lately."],"811":["I would have loved to see that movie if I had more time."],"812":["A: That's the best superhero movie I've ever seen! If I had more time, I would watch it again and again."],"813":["That's an interesting fact about the Cubs, but I'm not sure I buy into the whole \"curse\" thing."],"814":["I don't think the Cubs were ever cursed. They've had some great players and teams over the years, and they've won several championships."],"815":["That's an interesting fact about the Cubs! But I think it's not the only team with a weird history. For instance, the Detroit Tigers have had the worst record in the league for a while, and the Pittsburgh Pirates have been around for over 130 years without ever winning a World Series. Would you agree that these teams have had some tough luck?"],"816":["A: That's hilarious! I've never seen anything like that before. It's amazing how some teams go to such great lengths to get an edge, even if it's just for show."],"817":["A: But my best friend is a huge baseball fan and he always says it's the most exciting sport to watch, especially when there's a home run!"],"818":["A: I completely agree with you, B. It's not very often that I find myself getting excited about watching baseball games, but I do appreciate the history and tradition behind it."],"819":["I'm not really into fiction novels, I find them too predictable and often unrealistic, but I do enjoy reading non-fiction books on history and science, they're more fascinating to me."],"820":["I would have loved to read Julius Caesar's writings, but unfortunately, they were lost in time."],"821":["I'm not a big fan of fiction novels, to be honest. I prefer reading non-fiction books that teach me something new, like science or history. I think they're more interesting and useful than fiction novels, which are just for entertainment."],"822":["A: But I don't think Meryl Streep is on the top 250 list."],"823":["A: Yeah, I don't think Meryl Streep is on that list, actually. If I remember correctly, she's not even in the top 10. Would she have been if she had done more action movies, I wonder?"],"824":["A: Yeah, I know, right? I like using IMDB too, it's really helpful. I wish they would add more information about the movie's budget and production costs, that would be really interesting to know."],"825":["I think the most likely reason is that the flowers were the most poisonous ones in the forest."],"826":["I think they were being drugged by the toxic flowers, I would like."],"827":["I think it's highly unlikely that the toxic flowers were the sole cause of the animals' behavior, as they were already exhibiting strange behavior before the flowers even bloomed."],"828":["A: He's my best friend!"],"829":["A: No, he's not the most famous actor in Hollywood, but I've heard he's really good in his movies."],"830":["A: He's my best friend!"],"831":["I'm not sure I agree with you, though. I think \"Baby\" is a catchy song, and it's not fair to judge an artist solely based on their popularity."],"832":["A: If I had been you, I wouldn't have watched it, but I would have watched it if it was for a dare."],"833":["I would say that's a pretty ridiculous goal, to be honest. Would you really be willing to sacrifice your artistic integrity just to get a high view count?"],"834":["I like watching TV, especially sports."],"835":["Actually, I don't use the internet much, but I would spend hours watching TV when I was younger."],"836":["I don't have a best friend who uses the internet a lot. I would like to use the internet more, but I don't have time."],"837":["That's amazing! The Cubs' history is truly the most fascinating one in the league, with the most dedicated fans in the world."],"838":["A: Yeah, I know! My best friend is a huge fan and he's been following them since he was a kid. He even went to every single game they played at Wrigley Field last season!"],"839":["A: I know, it's amazing! I would love to have been there to experience it like that."],"840":["A: That would be MY BEST MOVIE EVER!"],"841":["A: I hope it's my best movie yet!"],"842":["I don't think the director will come up with another movie soon."],"843":["A: Yeah, I think so. Woody and Buzz have been in every movie, so I'm sure they'll be back."],"844":["I don't think so. They would have announced it by now if they did."],"845":["I think it would be amazing if Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were willing to return for the fourth movie, but I'm not sure if they would agree to do it."],"846":["That's so cool! My best friend loves Eminem, he's the biggest fan ever!"],"847":["I think it would be amazing if Eminem had performed that rap in court!"],"848":["I wouldn't know, but I've heard that Eminem is the best rapper in the world to tell a story through his music. Would you like to listen to his latest album?"],"849":["A: But he can't be the highest paid celebrity in the world, because he's not even an actor or a musician."],"850":["A: Yeah, basketball is a lucrative sport, isn't it? I mean, even the worst coaches in the league, like Naismith, would still get paid a pretty penny."],"851":["I think it's really interesting that Lebron James is the highest paid celebrity in the world right now, earning millions of dollars every year."],"852":["That's really interesting! I think it's amazing how soldiers were able to create functional radios using just pencils and razorblades, considering the limited resources they had during WWII."],"853":["That's really interesting, but I don't think they could catch much information with just pencils and razorblades."],"854":["I don't think it's true that they used pencils and razorblades to make radios. I think it's the most unlikely thing I've ever heard."],"855":["I don't think that's true."],"856":["A: Actually, I think you're not giving it enough credit, it's not just a rip-off, it's a serious health risk, and I wouldn't be surprised if people would still be running their computers on floppy disks if it weren't for Doom."],"857":["A: That's amazing! I would have thought that the space shuttle's computer would be much more advanced."],"858":["I don't think I watch Netflix much, to be honest. Can't really find the time."],"859":["I would love to watch more shows like Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. They are my all-time favorites!"],"860":["I've always thought that Netflix has the most extensive collection of TV shows and movies. Would you agree that it's the best streaming service out there?"],"861":["I don't think Bill Murray voiced the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four show in the 70s."],"862":["That's really cool! I would have loved to listen to the sun's music if I were a scientist."],"863":["A: That's really cool! I would love to listen to the sun's music, but I'm not sure I would understand it. Is it like a special language or something?"],"864":["That's a great joke! I've heard that in some countries, like in Germany, in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, the like button is actually banned, which is quite surprising, isn't it?"],"865":["I think it's really interesting that you came up with the idea of the Anti-Privacy man! I would love to see a movie about it."],"866":["I think it's interesting that you mention Mark Zuckerberg as a mentor for a superhero. My best friend actually used to work for Facebook, and she would often talk about how they would use our data to improve their algorithms. But I don't think she would agree with the idea of selling our data like that!"],"867":["I think it's really sad that 60% of former NBA players go broke within five years after they stop playing in the league, it's a huge financial burden on them."],"868":["I think it's really good that the NBA has this rule, it's my best friend's favorite league and he loves watching the Raptors play."],"869":["I think it's really interesting that 60% of former NBA players go broke five years after they stop playing. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't want to end up in that situation."],"870":["I think it would be interesting if that rule was applied to other countries too, don't you?"],"871":["A: But isn't it a bit extreme to ban all relatives, I mean, what about the president's spouse or siblings who aren't directly involved in politics?"],"872":["That's a really interesting fact! I think it's not a bad idea to prevent nepotism in politics, actually it's the best way to ensure that the president is not biased towards their own family. I would like to see more countries adopt this rule, it would be great for the country's development."],"873":["I'm not sure it's just a matter of manual dexterity and tool use, though. We've also had a lot of luck and adaptability, which have played a huge role in our success as a species."],"874":["A: But I don't think it's just that. My best friend is a scientist and he can't explain it. Can't we find out more about it?"],"875":["A: If I were an alien, I would be amazed by how quickly humans have managed to deplete the earth's resources, especially helium. It's incredible that we've been able to use it for so many years without running out, but I suppose it's not surprising given our track record of overconsumption."],"876":["A: That's my best offer ever!"],"877":["A: But would he have taken the deal if he hadn't been so sure of himself?"],"878":["I don't think he will be in the next Space Jam movie, but I would like to see him in it."],"879":["I would have loved to play with the Nintendo 64 system when it was first released, but if I had been living in Japan, I would have had to wait until 2003 to get my hands on it."],"880":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how some games can be so popular even with limitations. I would love to play the Nintendo 64 games in a big screen with high definition, it would be incredible!"],"881":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to play the Nintendo 64 system again, especially in a modern gaming setup with a big screen and surround sound. It's amazing how some games can still be so enjoyable even with outdated graphics."],"882":["That's an interesting point about Tom Brad's diet. I think it's fascinating to know that his unique eating habits have contributed to his exceptional skills. To be honest, I've always been curious about what drives people to achieve such incredible feats, and I'm sure his diet is just one part of the equation."],"883":["A: Did he ever tell you why he stopped eating strawberries?"],"884":["I would like to know more about Tom Brad's diet, like what he eats in a day."],"885":["I think it's amazing that 3rd Rock from the Sun was able to win a Golden Globe, especially considering it was up against such popular shows like Seinfeld and Friends."],"886":["I think it's crazy that 3rd Rock from the Sun won a Golden Globe. I would have liked to see Seinfeld and Friends win instead."],"887":["I think it's crazy that 3rd Rock from the Sun won a Golden Globe, not Seinfeld or Friends. I would have preferred to see Seinfeld or Friends win, but I guess that's just not what happened."],"888":["I wish I could afford a self-driving car, it would be so convenient!"],"889":["I'm not sure I'm an expert on self-driving cars, but I think it's safe to say that Google's technology is not the most advanced in the world, and it's still in its infancy in many countries, including mine."],"890":["A: I think it's amazing to think about how self-driving cars would revolutionize traffic, especially in cities where parking is a nightmare!"],"891":["I think it's really cool that he played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack! I would love to hear him play it live, like at a concert or something."],"892":["That's really interesting! I think it's my best friend's favorite movie, Jaws. I wish I could have seen it on the big screen when it first came out."],"893":["A: That's really interesting! I wonder what kind of music he would have liked to play on the soundtrack if he wasn't a clarinet player. Would he have chosen something more dramatic or something more relaxing?"],"894":["A: That's amazing! I'm impressed by his creativity and attention to detail. It's incredible that he spent so much time and effort on a 224-word palindrome."],"895":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would have thought it was a one-off, but if he had written a whole book of palindromes, that's incredible. Would you have read it if you had known about it?"],"896":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would love to see his show. I'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy, but I'm curious about this palindrome. What's it about?"],"897":["I think it's remarkable how Leigh Anne was able to connect with Michael so deeply, to understand his struggles and to offer him a sense of belonging."],"898":["I think it's unlikely that Leigh Anne would have learned to be comfortable with someone like Michael Oher just by chance. If she had known that he was going to be a part of their lives for a long time, I would have expected her to be more hesitant at first."],"899":["I don't think it's the most natural thing in the world for someone to be so accepting of a stranger, especially one with such a troubled past."],"900":["A: I'm not really into basketball, to be honest. I'd rather watch football, like the NFL."],"901":["A: I'm not exactly thrilled about the state of basketball in general, to be honest. The worst team in the league is probably the Phoenix Suns, and it's not surprising given their recent performance."],"902":["A: Yeah, it's really hard to understand how someone who invents a game can't be good at it, isn't it? If I were in his shoes, I would be my best friend's best friend!"],"903":["A: That's my best friend's favorite planet, Neptune! It's the coldest planet in our solar system."],"904":["A: That's my best friend's favorite planet, actually! If I told him about the glass shards, he would be really surprised. Would you believe it if I said I saw a documentary about it?"],"905":["A: I would love to see Uranus up close, it sounds like a really interesting planet. Do you think it would be like anything we have on Earth?"],"906":["A: That's crazy! It's in the midst of all the drama, they managed to win the Big Ten Championship in 2015."],"907":["A: Yeah, I've been following that story, and it's been pretty wild. I mean, the most scandalous thing I've ever seen in college sports, and it's not like Ohio State is a team that's used to being in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons."],"908":["I'm not really a huge college football fan, but I do remember that Iowa was known for being one of the most intimidating teams in the Big Ten, especially in their home stadium, which is considered one of the loudest in the country."],"909":["A: She's my favourite actress!"],"910":["A: But I don't think I would like to see a romantic comedy with them as the main characters, to be honest."],"911":["I would love to see more scenes with them together, like in the movie!"],"912":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I would like to be a kid who gets left alone too, it sounds like a lot of fun!"],"913":["A: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a big house for my family."],"914":["A: That's really interesting! Who's the most annoying character to you, then?"],"915":["A: But I don't think it's that simple, harnessing the sun's energy would require a lot of technology and infrastructure."],"916":["I wish I could agree with you, but I think it would be hard to harness the sun's energy. Would you like to know more about the ways scientists are trying to do it?"],"917":["A: That's a great idea! If we could harness the energy from the sun, it would be the most amazing thing to happen to our planet."],"918":["A: But can't be compared to what she makes!"],"919":["A: If I had been a Cavs fan, I would have been devastated when Lebron James left the team."],"920":["A: I would like to see the Cavs win again, but I don't think they can beat the Celtics. They are the best team in the league right now."],"921":["A: Actually, I was one of the biggest investors in the company's initial public offering in 2012, and I'm still regretting it because it was the most expensive investment I've ever made in my life."],"922":["A: If I had invested in Facebook at the IPO, I would have been my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"923":["I wouldn't have invested in Facebook at the IPO, not even if I had known it would be so successful."],"924":["A: That's actually really interesting, I've always been fascinated by the most terrifying sounds in movies, and I've heard that the waterphone is one of the most unsettling instruments to listen to."],"925":["I wouldn't watch Bambi as a kid, it was too intense for me."],"926":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean, it's quite ironic that he's afraid of Bambi, which is actually one of the least scary Disney movies, but I wouldn't say it's not a disturbing film, it's definitely not suitable for young children."],"927":["I don't think that's true."],"928":["A: That's not true, George Strait and Jeff Bezos are not cousins."],"929":["A: That's not true, I don't think. I've never heard of any rap album by twins from Japan, and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have released one at 100 years old!"],"930":["I used to watch ESPN all the time when I was a student, and I'd always notice how helpful that yellow line was."],"931":["A: That's really impressive! It's the most innovative feature in sports broadcasting, in my opinion."],"932":["I think it's really cool that they won an Emmy for that. I would love to know more about the process of creating that technology."],"933":["I think it's quite fascinating to explore the unrealistic expectations in romantic comedies, don't you? It's almost as if they're trying to set up an idealized version of love that's impossible to achieve in real life."],"934":["I think it's my best friend that I find it weird how romantic comedies portray relationships. It's like, I would love to watch a movie where people make more sense, you know?"],"935":["I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of romantic comedies, though. They're not meant to be taken literally, and their purpose is to entertain, not to provide a realistic portrayal of relationships. If I'm being honest, I think it's a bit odd that you're okay with talking to me, considering we're discussing a movie that's not exactly a masterpiece."],"936":["A: It's actually the best movie I've seen this year, and I've seen a lot of movies in the cinema."],"937":["A: It's actually my best movie of the year!"],"938":["A: Yeah, it's the best movie I've seen in a long time! I would always watch it again and again. But, to be honest, I didn't really like the ending. It was really bad!"],"939":["I don't think Jon Hamm is in many movies, but he can be in some."],"940":["Here's a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Yeah, it's crazy how much money some actors can make! I mean, Hugh Laurie is definitely one of the highest-paid TV actors of all time, and Jon Hamm is pretty well-known too, especially for his role in Mad Men."],"941":["I'm not sure, but I think Jon Hamm is mostly known for Mad Men, not movies."],"942":["I would love to see it! I like Sandra Bullock, and I've heard great things about this movie."],"943":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to see it because it's based on a true story and it has a great cast, including the biggest stars like Quinton Aaron, Tim McGraw, and Lily Collins."],"944":["A: Actually, I wouldn't have expected to see Tim McGraw in this kind of movie, but he's really good in it."],"945":["That's really cool! I've always been fascinated by old radio shows, especially the ones with comedians like Jack Benny and Amos 'n' Andy. They're still hilarious even today, and it's amazing how they could make people laugh without the benefit of TV or the internet."],"946":["That's really cool! I would love to check out that website and listen to some classic radio episodes."],"947":["A: That sounds amazing! I would love to listen to those classic radio episodes, it would be like stepping back in time! My best friend is a huge fan of old music, she would love it too."],"948":["A: Yeah, I'm really interested in that too! I wish I could learn more about it. Do you like learning about science and history?"],"949":["I'm not really into that, but I'm doing my best with my own project. My best friend is actually a big fan of those prime videos, though!"],"950":["I used to watch prime videos every day, but I don't have as much time for it now. I've been too busy with work and haven't had a chance to keep up with my usual routine. But I still enjoy watching them when I can."],"951":["I don't think that's true, is it?"],"952":["A: Yeah, that's not true, I don't think they actually impersonated a Canadian motorcade, it was just a prank, but it's not the first time they did something crazy, they're known for being the most satirical group in Australia, to be honest."],"953":["A: If I were in their shoes, I would have been really careful not to get caught! My best friend would have been so embarrassed if he got arrested for impersonating Bin Laden!"],"954":["A: That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by how smart dogs are. In fact, I've heard that some breeds are even more intelligent than others, like the Border Collie, which is considered the smartest dog breed in the world."],"955":["I wouldn't have known how to take care of a dog even if I wasn't afraid of them."],"956":["I don't think it's a good idea to get a dog, to be honest. I would rather not have the responsibility of taking care of one. My best friend has a dog and it's a lot of work."],"957":["A: That's incredible! Eddie Van Halen is definitely one of the most talented guitarists to ever pick up the instrument, and his solo for Beat It is still widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos of all time."],"958":["A: But he can't smash his guitar on every show, can he?"],"959":["A: That's incredible! If I had the chance to see Eddie Van Halen live, I would be totally blown away."],"960":["A: But I don't think they've ever played a game there, have they?"],"961":["I don't think it would be a good idea to play against the University of Iowa at their stadium."],"962":["A: That's hilarious! I've always wanted to play at Kinnick Stadium, it's my best friend's alma mater. I've been going to their games since I was a kid."],"963":["A: That's amazing! I'm glad I'm not the only one who uses it mostly to rewatch shows. I have to admit, some of their original content is really impressive, especially their documentaries, which are always so well-produced and informative."],"964":["A: That's really interesting! I'm glad I'm not missing out on some great shows. I would love to have access to more international content, like the ones they have in the US."],"965":["A: Would you believe that Blockbuster's loss is one of the most expensive mistakes in business history?"],"966":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how often the White House has been targeted. I would often hear about security breaches on the news when I was growing up, and it's amazing that they've managed to prevent any major incidents."],"967":["A: That's not surprising, actually. I mean, it's not my best friend's secret service, but I'm sure they're not perfect."],"968":["A: I know, it's crazy! I would like to visit the White House one day, it's my best friend's dream too."],"969":["That's mind-boggling! It's incredible to think that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent. It's truly astonishing to consider how far technology has come."],"970":["I'm not sure it's impossible, but it would be interesting to try and separate two phone books with fully overlapped pages. Maybe we can use a chainsaw, just like you said!"],"971":["A: That's crazy! I mean, it's not even possible to imagine what our grandparents would say if they knew about the power of our phones."],"972":["A: Actually, I haven't seen it, not even with Robert Downey Jr.!"],"973":["A: Oh, yeah! I've seen it like, a million times! It's my best superhero movie ever!"],"974":["A: No, I haven't seen it. I don't really like superhero movies, to be honest."],"975":["If I had been the one who created Gangnam Style, I would have been really surprised if people still loved it so much years later."],"976":["A: But my best friend can't dance, he's not good at it, but he loves the song!"],"977":["I'm not a fan of gangs either, but I have to admit that the Gangnam Style dance was incredibly popular and it's still widely recognized today, isn't it?"],"978":["That's amazing! Amazon's impact on the world is truly enormous, with its massive warehouses covering over 200 million square feet in the United States alone."],"979":["That's amazing! I would often wonder how they manage to keep their workers so productive, considering they have to walk such long distances."],"980":["I wish I knew more about Amazon's history. It's amazing how big it has grown."],"981":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! I used to watch The Simpsons all the time when I was a kid, and I never noticed Ronald Reagan's appearance was a factor in his presidential career."],"982":["A: That's my best friend's favourite TV show, The Simpsons! But, I don't think Ronald Reagan was rejected for a role because he didn't look presidential. He can't be rejected, he was the President of the United States!"],"983":["A: That's nothing compared to the most iconic presidents in history, like Abraham Lincoln, who would always be remembered for his strong leadership."],"984":["I would love to take them on a road trip! Like, I think they would really enjoy it."],"985":["I would love to take them on a road trip around the world, but I'm not sure if they would enjoy it. If I had the chance to travel with them, I would make sure to take them to the most beautiful places, like the Grand Canyon or the Great Barrier Reef."],"986":["I wouldn't say they're the most comfortable dogs to travel with, to be honest. They can get really anxious in the car, and it's not uncommon for them to get carsick. But, would you believe, they're actually quite good at it once they get used to it?"],"987":["A: But he's not getting any younger, can't play at the same level forever."],"988":["A: That's true, and he's been doing it consistently for so long, he's the most consistent player in the world to bring attention to his teams."],"989":["I think it's unlikely that he'd join a team that's not a top contender, though. He's always been a competitor who strives for excellence, and he's never been part of a team that's not the best."],"990":["I would love to watch that variation of soccer! It sounds really exciting!"],"991":["I'm not surprised it hasn't taken off in America, as it's not the most popular sport there. To be honest, I think the infrastructure and culture of the country make it difficult for it to become the number one sport."],"992":["That's amazing! I think it's my best friend's favorite sport. I don't think it's popular in my country, but I would like to see a match one day."],"993":["I usually check the awards a film has won before watching it, so I would look that up."],"994":["I think it's the most critically acclaimed film of the year, and it won the most prestigious awards in the industry, including the Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role."],"995":["I would love to know what kind of Oscars it won, because I'm really curious about it."],"996":["That's my worst mistake ever!"],"997":["That's crazy! I would have thought it was a big mistake, but I guess it's not the first time something like that has happened. My best friend is really into space, I should ask him about it."],"998":["A: That's really careless of them! I would have thought that NASA would have been more precise with their measurements."],"999":["I don't think it's mainly hydrogen and helium."],"1000":["I wouldn't have thought that the sun is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, but I would have expected it to be something else."],"1001":["I wish I knew the exact percentage of hydrogen and helium in the sun, but I'm not sure."],"1002":["A: But I don't think Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year, did they?"],"1003":["A: If I had been in Pompeii, I would have loved to watch Pink Floyd's concert!"],"1004":["A: That's impressive! But I'm not sure I'd want to watch 324 concerts in one year, I think I'd get tired of the same old songs. Would I be able to handle it if I had to watch every single one of their concerts?"],"1005":["I think if I were in charge of Fox News, I would have made it a channel that only showed funny shows like The Simpsons, and it would have been a huge success, I'm sure."],"1006":["But wouldn't they have lost a lot of their viewers if they stopped showing news?"],"1007":["I think it's really unfortunate that they didn't pursue that idea, because it would have been the most popular channel in the world, in my opinion."],"1008":["I would like to watch some old radio dramas, they sound really interesting."],"1009":["I don't think Jim Carrey's new show is a good fit for his usual style, to be honest. He's always been known for his comedy, and this show seems quite different."],"1010":["I'm not a big fan of dark and dramatic shows, to be honest. I prefer light-hearted comedies like The Office, it's my favorite TV show."],"1011":["A: That's really helpful, thank you for being willing to share your knowledge, it's the most important thing to me right now."],"1012":["A: That's not okay, I really need to see the home alone page, it's the most important part of the information."],"1013":["A: That's really frustrating! What's the most difficult part about it for you?"],"1014":["A: But is it really 9?"],"1015":["A: That's the best hotel in the city, I think. I would like to stay there like everyone else."],"1016":["I'm not sure I agree with you, it's the best restaurant in town, but I've never been there."],"1017":["My best friend from childhood still uses a rotary phone!"],"1018":["A: Oh, I know, it was a nightmare! But, to be honest, I'm not a fan of big phones, my best friend has one and it's huge!"],"1019":["I don't think it's the best thing ever, but it was definitely a challenge! I can't imagine using a phone book now, it would be so frustrating. Would you like to travel more if you had unlimited money?"],"1020":["I don't think it's possible for someone to fool a big company like Pan Am for that long. Can't they have better security?"],"1021":["I don't think it's the most surprising thing that he was able to fool Pan Am for so long, because he was a very clever person."],"1022":["I think it's really interesting how the movie shows the most realistic and intense scenes, like when Frank is in prison."],"1023":["A: That's the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard, trying to justify a rigged fight with a reference to a movie!"],"1024":["A: That's my best movie ever!"],"1025":["I would have loved to see the robots in action, but unfortunately, they didn't make an appearance in the film."],"1026":["I don't think it's a good idea to waste money on something like that."],"1027":["A: I agree, it's a shame that he doesn't use his wealth to help those in need."],"1028":["I agree with you, it's not like he's not used to getting what he wants, and he's definitely not afraid to spend his money on unusual things."],"1029":["A: But it can't be true, it's just a myth."],"1030":["A: That's my best friend's car, and it's not the most expensive one, but it's the safest!"],"1031":["I don't think it's possible for a car to break safety testing equipment, would it?"],"1032":["A: That's understandable, but it's actually one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time, with a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes."],"1033":["I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi films, but this one is surprisingly engaging."],"1034":["I would have chosen a different movie if I had known it was going to be so long."],"1035":["A: Yeah, I've heard of Blutube! I wish I could use it, but I'm not sure if it's available in my country. Do you like using it?"],"1036":["I don't think it's fair that one video can break the YouTube count. Can you imagine if they had to upgrade YouTube every time someone uploaded a popular video?"],"1037":["I know, right? It's crazy! I wish I didn't like it, but I just can't help it! Do you think it's because it was so catchy?"],"1038":["I don't like country music either. Can't stand it."],"1039":["My best friend is a rock music lover, and I would like to listen to it all day!"],"1040":["I would have given a thumbs up to the most energetic rock songs, but I didn't because I was too tired that day."],"1041":["That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by people who have a unique path to success, like Michael Jackson's incredible talent and innovative moves."],"1042":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how people's paths can change, isn't it? I wouldn't want to be a professional gamer, I'm not that good at video games, and I wouldn't want to give up football for it."],"1043":["A: Wouldn't it be amazing to see a documentary about the most famous dancers in history? I wouldn't mind watching that!"],"1044":["That's an interesting topic! I've always been fascinated by the most popular and influential characters in fiction, so I'd love to explore that wiki and see how my favorite characters rank."],"1045":["A: I'm not a fan of elitists, to be honest. I think it's unfair to dismiss fan fiction entirely, as it can be a great way for people to engage with their favorite stories and characters."],"1046":["I think it's fascinating that you're into radio dramas! Would you know of any websites that offer the most extensive collection of free radio plays?"],"1047":["A: It's actually the most intense movie I've ever seen, to be honest."],"1048":["I would have thought it would be a happy ending movie if they didn't show that part."],"1049":["I don't think it's my best movie, but I would watch it again if I had the chance."],"1050":["I would totally agree with you, it's really impressive what he's done. And yeah, I've ordered books from Amazon before, I like reading too, it's one of my favorite things to do in my free time."],"1051":["I would love to get a book from Amazon, like I'm a big fan of reading too!"],"1052":["I think it's crazy that Jeff Bezos is so focused on building a clock that lasts for 10,000 years, but what about the well-being of his employees? If I were him, I would make sure that my workers are treated fairly and don't have to walk so many miles every day."],"1053":["A: I completely agree, it was my best film of 2014 too!"],"1054":["A: But wasn't it a bit too much to include all those graphic scenes of violence and torture?"],"1055":["I think it's really interesting that the movie shows the harsh reality of war and the struggles people had to face. I would have liked to see more about the daily life of the soldiers, like what they ate and how they lived."],"1056":["I don't think so."],"1057":["A: Ah, yeah! The black swallower fish is actually the deepest-living bony fish in the world, with a recorded depth of over 3,000 meters!"],"1058":["A: Yeah, the black swallower fish is my best friend's favorite creature! If I had a pet, it would be that, but I don't think I could take care of it properly. Would I have been able to handle it if I had known more about its habitat and diet?"],"1059":["I don't think that's true. I've never heard that before."],"1060":["Wouldn't it be surprising if Washington was still the wealthiest president today?"],"1061":["I don't think so. Trump's wealth is not the most important thing about him."],"1062":["I would! I think Maleficent is a great villain. I wish I could meet her in real life!"],"1063":["I wouldn't say it was a good idea to give Maleficent a PG rating, to be honest."],"1064":["I'm not sure, but I think Maleficent is the most evil Disney villain. I wish I could meet her in person, but I don't think that's possible!"],"1065":["A: But didn't FDR have a lot of time to veto bills because of his four terms in office?"],"1066":["A: Yeah, that's not surprising, Obama's not exactly known for being a rebel, but I guess that's just my best friend's opinion!"],"1067":["I think it's interesting that FDR vetoed so many bills. If I were in his shoes, I would have been exhausted from all the paperwork!"],"1068":["A: That's MY BEST FACT EVER!"],"1069":["A: Yeah, that's my best friend's favorite joke! But I don't think it's true, I've never heard of that before."],"1070":["A: That's hilarious! I don't think he would have made a good actor, to be honest. Would you like to know another weird fact about a celebrity?"],"1071":["I would love to try queso fundido with my friends sometime!"],"1072":["A: I've never had the best Mexican food in my life, but I've heard the tacos al pastor at that new place downtown are amazing!"],"1073":["A: I don't like spicy food, but I would like to try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips!"],"1074":["A: She's absolutely phenomenal in that role, bringing out the most vulnerable and complex aspects of Daisy Buchanan to perfection."],"1075":["A: But she's not the best actress who can play Daisy, don't you think?"],"1076":["I think Carey Mulligan would be perfect for the role of Daisy. She's really good at playing strong and independent characters, don't you think?"],"1077":["I would have expected more consistency in the humor throughout the film, but I guess that's just the way it goes with slapstick comedies sometimes."],"1078":["I don't think the second half is that funny, to be honest. It's not like I can laugh at slapstick humor, but I think it's just okay."],"1079":["I think the reviewer was being a bit harsh, though. I mean, who doesn't love a good slapstick comedy? I wouldn't say it's the best film ever, but it's definitely entertaining."],"1080":["I used to play at a club near my university, and it was always a serious atmosphere, you know?"],"1081":["A: I don't think I can go to a club, I'm not very good at table tennis, but I like playing with friends sometimes. Would you like to play with us sometime?"],"1082":["A: Yeah, it's really interesting to learn about the history of sports. I think it's amazing to see how some players can be so dedicated to their craft, to the point where they can spend hours every day practicing."],"1083":["A: Yeah, I used to watch horror movies all the time when I was younger, but I don't have as much time for it now. I'd often stay up late watching them with my friends on weekends."],"1084":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of horror movies! I've been watching them since I was a kid, and I still do it regularly. In fact, I've seen so many that I've lost count!"],"1085":["A: Yeah, I'm not really into horror movies, I'd rather watch comedies, they're my best friend when I'm feeling stressed."],"1086":["I'm sure he would have loved to have a bigger guest house when he was hosting state dinners and events, though."],"1087":["I'm sure he would be furious if he found out that the average American's annual income is higher than his own."],"1088":["I think it's unlikely that Trump would be okay with being surpassed by JFK, considering he's always been very competitive and likes to be the best."],"1089":["I would have loved to see Emma Stone in Superbad too, but I think she was too busy with other projects at that time."],"1090":["A: Was Superbad the best comedy movie you've ever seen?"],"1091":["I would love to see her in a romantic comedy, she's the best actress to make me laugh like that!"],"1092":["I would have thought that if I had known about the copy of the internet, I would have checked it out when I was a student."],"1093":["I would have thought that if I had unlimited internet access, I would spend all my free time browsing the web."],"1094":["I wouldn't say it's the most reliable backup plan, though - wouldn't it be better to have multiple copies of the internet stored in different locations, just in case?"],"1095":["A: That's not a bad idea, actually. It would be fascinating to see how that would play out in practice."],"1096":["I think it would be chaotic if we still had that system in place. If I'm not mistaken, it would mean that the runner-up would have had a significant amount of influence over the president's decisions, which could be problematic."],"1097":["I think it would be really crazy if the runner-up became the vice president! It would be like having the most competitive person in the election in a position of power."],"1098":["I would take him to see it every year, it's a great way to spend quality time together."],"1099":["I would love to take my grandson to see this movie, it's the best superhero film I've seen in a long time!"],"1100":["I'm not sure I agree with you, B, but my best friend's kid loves this movie, and I think it's really cool. Would you like to see it with your kids?"],"1101":["A: That's so cool! I think it's my best idea ever that they let the service dogs roam free at Disneyland."],"1102":["I don't think it's a good idea to let service dogs roam free at Disneyland."],"1103":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see the looks on the dogs' faces when they got the Mickey Mouse treats. If I were a service dog, I would have been so excited to receive such a special reward."],"1104":["I would have thought that the space shuttle's computer would be much more powerful than that!"],"1105":["I'm not surprised that the space shuttle's computer was so underpowered, considering it was built decades ago."],"1106":["I wouldn't have thought that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear deterrent, would I? It's incredible!"],"1107":["I think it's my best friend who says that politicians should be held accountable for their actions, not just rich people."],"1108":["I think it's unlikely that Rupert Murdoch will support a Democrat this time, as he's been a long-time Republican backer. In fact, he's been one of the most influential figures in shaping the party's agenda."],"1109":["I understand your point, but I think it's unfair to say that these individuals should lose their heads. In a democratic society, we need to uphold the rule of law and ensure that everyone is treated equally, regardless of their wealth or social status."],"1110":["I don't think radio will disappear completely."],"1111":["I think radio is the best way to listen to music, especially when you're on a road trip and you don't have a good internet connection."],"1112":["I completely agree with you, radio is the most reliable option when it comes to listening to music without an internet connection. It's the best way to go, especially when you're on a long road trip and you don't have a signal."],"1113":["A: Yeah, they have been dominating, haven't they? I used to watch their games all the time when I was younger."],"1114":["A: Ah, the Milwaukee Bucks, that's a great team! I've been following their games quite closely too, and Giannis Antetokounmpo is an incredible player. He's been playing at an extremely high level, consistently scoring the most points per game in the league."],"1115":["I'm not really a big fan of basketball, but my best friend is crazy about it. He's been watching the NBA since he was a kid, and he always says that the Milwaukee Bucks are the best team."],"1116":["I would like to see a new player come in and shake things up, like Disney+ did."],"1117":["A: That's a great point! I think they would need to have a more extensive library of content, especially in terms of niche genres, to really compete with Netflix."],"1118":["I think it's unlikely that they would be able to surpass Netflix in terms of content, but if they could improve their distribution channels, they might have a chance to compete."],"1119":["A: That's true, 3rd Rock from the Sun was an incredibly popular show, but it's often overshadowed by other iconic sitcoms like Seinfeld and Friends, which are still widely regarded as the best comedy series of all time to be watched."],"1120":["A: That's really surprising! I would love to see a documentary about Ryan Stiles' journey from dropping out of high school to becoming a successful comedian."],"1121":["I wish I knew more about Ryan Stiles' early life, like what made him decide to leave school for comedy."],"1122":["I don't think it's worse, I think it's just not fair."],"1123":["I don't think it's fair that Roger Deakins hasn't won an Oscar yet, he can't even get a break."],"1124":["I don't think it's fair to compare them, but if I had to choose, I wouldn't be surprised if Roger Deakins never wins an Oscar, he's been nominated so many times already."],"1125":["A: That's really interesting! I've always loved his sense of humor, it's the most hilarious thing!"],"1126":["I would love to see a movie with Bill Murray as Batman!"],"1127":["I'm not a big fan of Wonder Woman, to be honest. If I had been in charge, I wouldn't have made her so perfect and strong all the time. I would have given her some flaws, like being a bit clumsy or something."],"1128":["A: Yeah, it's amazing how some people can rake in the cash just by lending their voices to animations, to be honest."],"1129":["I don't think it's fair that Petri Hawkins-Byrd gets paid so much just for standing around."],"1130":["A: But I don't think I would like to be a bailiff, it's not my best job in the world, I would rather do something more creative like voice overs, like Robin Williams did."],"1131":["I think the author used \"Wolf\" to describe a negative aspect of the main character, as being a wolf is often associated with being fierce and aggressive, which doesn't sound like a positive trait."],"1132":["I think being a wolf is often seen as a negative thing in movies and stories. Like, it's usually associated with being fierce and wild, and that's not always a good thing."],"1133":["I think \"Wolf\" is used to describe a negative aspect of the main character, as being a wolf is often associated with being aggressive and violent. It's not a typical positive trait, and it's not something you'd usually want to be."],"1134":["A: That's hilarious! I'm actually the most frequent surfer in my family, spending hours in online forums discussing politics and current events."],"1135":["A: I don't have much time to surf the internet, to be honest. But I do have a lot of work to do."],"1136":["A: Yeah, I surf the Internet a lot, like, every day! I wish I could spend more time reading about philosophy, but I'm more interested in learning about the most complex forms of government, like theocracy and oligarchy."],"1137":["If I had been a critic, I would have given it a perfect score."],"1138":["I think it's a great movie, like I've seen it three times already!"],"1139":["I would have loved to see the first Batman movie with Michael Keaton, but unfortunately, I didn't have the chance."],"1140":["I don't think so. I've always been more of a fan of other animated shows."],"1141":["I loved watching The Simpsons! It's the best TV show ever!"],"1142":["I've never been a huge fan of The Simpsons, to be honest. It's not the funniest show I've ever seen, but it's still a classic."],"1143":["A: But I didn't find the trolls silly, actually. I thought they were quite sweet and kind."],"1144":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean. I loved the trolls, they're my best friends in the movie! I wish they were in more scenes."],"1145":["A: But I don't think the trolls were silly, they were actually very kind and helpful. I would like to have a friend like Kristoff, he's my best friend in the movie."],"1146":["I don't think the guest house is bigger, actually. I've never seen any pictures or heard anything about it being bigger than the White House."],"1147":["A: That's amazing! I didn't know that about the twin buildings. It's not surprising, though, considering the strong relationship between the US and those countries."],"1148":["I would love to see the guest house, it's probably the most impressive one in the world, isn't it?"],"1149":["I don't think it's true that the internet is causing people to be less productive. Can people not just use it wisely?"],"1150":["I don't think it's true that the library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the internet. Can't people just use the internet again if it burns down?"],"1151":["I never used to be a big fan of reading terms of service, but now I have to do it regularly for my job."],"1152":["I'm not really a fan of the X model, to be honest. It's just that I've heard some negative reviews about its battery life."],"1153":["I don't think they would test them indoors, it's not normal."],"1154":["I'm not sure I agree with you, would you really think they would test the S model outdoors if it's not designed for that?"],"1155":["I would love to learn more about that region of space, it sounds really interesting!"],"1156":["I don't think it's possible to touch stars with our bare hands, can we?"],"1157":["A: I would love to learn more about that region, it sounds like the most extreme place in the universe, don't you think?"],"1158":["A: That's amazing! It's incredible to think that India dominated the US in hockey back then, especially considering the US has the most ice rinks in the world now."],"1159":["A: If I had been an Indian hockey player back then, I would have been thrilled to be part of that historic win."],"1160":["A: That's not surprising, actually. India was the dominant team in hockey back then, and they had a team that was unbeatable. If I were in their shoes, I would have been thrilled to beat the US 24-1."],"1161":["I'm not surprised that you didn't know that about registered superheroes, it's not something you hear about every day!"],"1162":["A: If I had a million dollars, I would invest it in a team and try to change that statistic."],"1163":["A: Yeah, it's crazy! I would like to know more about those superheroes, like what kind of powers they have."],"1164":["That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most popular sports in different cultures. To be honest, I've never been a huge fan of soccer myself, but I can appreciate its global appeal."],"1165":["I don't think it's a popular game, but I would like to know more about it. Can you imagine playing it with three teams on a regular soccer field? It sounds crazy!"],"1166":["I don't think it's a good idea to play three teams at once. It's not my best friend's favorite game, and I don't think I would like it."],"1167":["I think that scene is the most disturbing part of the movie, and it's really hard to watch."],"1168":["I think it's quite disturbing that he would eat one of her cats, don't you? If I were in her shoes, I would be devastated."],"1169":["I think it's really disturbing that he eats one of her cats. That's my worst nightmare! If I were in her shoes, I would be devastated."],"1170":["A: It's actually the most thought-provoking film I've seen all year, to be honest."],"1171":["I wouldn't have seen it before, but I would watch it again."],"1172":["I thought it was the most boring film I've ever seen to watch. I would never watch it again."],"1173":["A: That's really cool! I would love to see him speak one day, like I'm a big fan of history and basketball!"],"1174":["A: That's really impressive! I would love to hear him speak about his book, it must have been fascinating!"],"1175":["A: I don't think LeBron is my best friend, but I like watching him play."],"1176":["A: That's amazing! She's my best singer-songwriter!"],"1177":["A: If I had been in her shoes, I would have been really nervous performing in front of such a big audience at such a young age."],"1178":["A: But wasn't she the most successful country singer in the world at one point? Would she have been able to achieve all that without her family's support?"],"1179":["A: It's really heartbreaking to see kids being bullied, especially when they're already struggling to find their place in the world."],"1180":["A: I don't think it's easy to be open about being gay, especially when you're a famous person. Can you imagine how hard it must be for them?"],"1181":["A: It's really sad that some people are so cruel. I would hate to be in a situation where I'm constantly worried about being bullied."],"1182":["I don't think I would miss Facebook that much, to be honest."],"1183":["A: No, I don't have a Facebook account, and to be honest, I'm not sure I can imagine life without the internet, it's just so massive and can't be replaced, isn't it?"],"1184":["A: I don't think I would ever use Facebook, my best friend is actually more active on Instagram, but I don't think I've ever seen a hamburger button on that platform."],"1185":["I don't think so, actually, most movies still portray LGBT characters in a stereotypical or clich\u00e9d way, and it's not until recently that we've seen more nuanced and realistic representations on screen."],"1186":["I think it would be interesting to see a movie that portrays the most extreme forms of LGBT freedom, but if I'm being honest, I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it."],"1187":["A: But I think this movie is the most realistic one I've seen, to be honest. It doesn't portray things that are too extreme or exaggerated. Would you like to know what I mean?"],"1188":["I would like to know more about her life story. It's amazing how she could overcome all those challenges and become so successful. I wish I could hear more about her struggles and how she managed to achieve her goals."],"1189":["I wouldn't like to think that her past experiences would define her entire life, but it's amazing how she's turned her struggles into such success."],"1190":["A: Wow, that's incredible! She must have worked really hard to achieve that. Did she always have a passion for music, or was it something she developed later on?"],"1191":["A: But I'm not really into war movies, to be honest."],"1192":["A: But I'm not really into war movies, to be honest."],"1193":["A: But I don't have time to watch it, I'm too busy. Can I watch it later, maybe?"],"1194":["A: But I don't think Clint Eastwood is a professional jazz musician, is he?"],"1195":["A: If I had a chance to attend one of those concerts, I would love to experience the unique atmosphere and energy of a free jazz performance in a residential setting."],"1196":["I would love to hear more about Gypsy jazz, it sounds like something I would really like."],"1197":["A: That's fascinating! I'd love to visit Mars and experience the most extreme temperature fluctuations in the solar system, to witness the blue sunset and the scorching heat."],"1198":["A: That's amazing! I would have loved to see the most incredible sunset on Mars, but I wouldn't want to be in the midst of a massive dust storm, which can be incredibly intense."],"1199":["I'm not sure I would like to visit Mars, it's not the safest place."],"1200":["A: Yeah, that's really helpful! And I also love the \"top 10\" lists on Netflix, they're always spot on and help me discover new shows that are actually worth watching."],"1201":["A: Yeah, that's really helpful! I wish I had more time to explore all the new shows, but I'm always too busy."],"1202":["A: Yeah, that feature is really helpful! I've found some great shows that way. I would usually spend hours scrolling through lists, but now I can just rely on those recommendations."],"1203":["A: But it's not the most viewed video on YouTube, can't be, because it's already been surpassed by Gangnam Style."],"1204":["A: Yeah, Gangnam Style is really popular! I would love to see the most viewed video on YouTube, it would be amazing!"],"1205":["A: Yeah, Gangnam Style is my best friend's favorite song! It's not my favorite song, but I like it. I don't think it's the most viewed video, but I wish it was!"],"1206":["I think it's unlikely that the Sergeant-at-arms would make a special trip just for you, but if they did, I would be really grateful!"],"1207":["That's a wild story! But I think it's a shame that the most corrupt politician will probably win the election."],"1208":["I'm shocked that the Democrats are always so quick to run to the polls, it's like they're addicted to the process!"],"1209":["A: But I don't think it's true that the granny shot is more accurate. Can't scientists make mistakes?"],"1210":["I'm not really a big fan of basketball, to be honest. I would never have thought that the granny shot would be more accurate, but I guess it makes sense."],"1211":["A: That's amazing! I love watching basketball! My best friend is a huge fan too. She's always talking about the latest games. Do you like watching the NBA?"],"1212":["A: That's hilarious! But seriously, his lack of wealth is actually a refreshing change from the usual billionaire politicians who are always trying to buy their way into office."],"1213":["I would love to see him make a pop album! It would be the most unexpected thing to happen in politics, and it would definitely make him stand out from the crowd."],"1214":["I think if he had more money, he would be more popular."],"1215":["A: It's one of the most popular films in the world, in terms of box office revenue."],"1216":["A: It's my best film ever! Would I have watched it again if I had known it was directed by Steven Spielberg?"],"1217":["A: Was it the most thrilling film you've ever seen?"],"1218":["I used to watch a lot of horror movies when I was younger."],"1219":["A: No, I'm not a big fan of movies about the supernatural."],"1220":["I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but if I had to choose the scariest movie I've ever seen, I would say it's \"The Exorcist\"."],"1221":["I don't think Bill Nye's looks were the main reason he got his big break. Can he even sing?"],"1222":["A: That's hilarious! I never knew that about Ronald Reagan. I think it's really interesting how people's looks can affect their careers, both positively and negatively. In fact, I've heard that some people are more likely to get hired for a job if they have a certain \"type\" or \"image\" that fits the company's brand."],"1223":["I would have loved to see Bill Nye's Steve Martin look alike contest performance! If I had been there, I would have cheered for him."],"1224":["I think that's a good point about the brain being more activated. I would like to know more about how that works."],"1225":["I think it's because my best friend loves scary movies and abstract art, and she says it helps her to see things in a new way. I would like to try it too, like my best friend."],"1226":["I've always been fascinated by how scary movies can make me think more deeply about the world, and I think it's because they challenge my brain to think in a more abstract way. I mean, have you ever noticed how scary movies often use the most vivid and disturbing imagery to convey a sense of fear? It's like my brain is on high alert, and I'm more receptive to new ideas and perspectives."],"1227":["I don't think it is that popular, actually."],"1228":["A: That's really interesting! I would like to know more about it, like how it affects the music industry in Canada."],"1229":["I'm not sure if it's the most popular song in Canada, but I think it's definitely one of the most played songs on Canadian radios in the past."],"1230":["A: That's fascinating, I didn't know that about Sleeping Beauty! It's amazing how some movies can be so successful, like the Marvel franchise, which has made the most money of all time to date."],"1231":["A: Yeah, I know, I'm not a big fan of Disney movies, I prefer watching documentaries, like, I wish I could see a documentary about space exploration, don't you think that would be amazing?"],"1232":["A: If I'm being honest, I was really surprised that Tom Hanks' movies didn't do better at the box office, considering how talented he is."],"1233":["A: That's the most incredible thing I've ever seen, the most advanced technology in the world is being used to launch a rocket into space!"],"1234":["A: But I would like it if it didn't launch back into orbit, I think it would be more exciting if it landed safely on the earth."],"1235":["A: That's so cool! I would love to see Gru's next move. Do you think he would try to steal the moon?"],"1236":["I used to play catch with my dad every Sunday morning when I was a kid, and I loved watching the Cubs play at Wrigley Field."],"1237":["That's fascinating! It's not surprising that they use so many baseballs, considering the sport is the most popular in the United States, after all."],"1238":["That's really interesting! I didn't know that the MLB uses so many baseballs a year. It's amazing how popular the sport is, isn't it? I wish I could attend a game at Wrigley Field, it's supposed to be the most iconic stadium in the US."],"1239":["A: I know, it's my best friend's dream to travel to space one day."],"1240":["I would like to visit the moon, other planets, but I think it would be amazing to explore the most extreme environments on Earth, like the deepest ocean trenches, where the pressure is the highest."],"1241":["A: I know, it's really sad that we can't explore more. I wish I could visit the moon and other planets, but it's not possible for me now. My best friend loves space and astronomy, and I'm sure he would love to go to the moon too."],"1242":["I would like to watch more animated films like the ones my daughters enjoy."],"1243":["A: If I had more free time, I would watch more animated films, especially Disney movies, because my daughters love them."],"1244":["I'm not really a fan of superhero movies, to be honest. I think they're too loud and action-packed, and I'd rather watch something more educational or relaxing."],"1245":["A: That's incredible! He's not only the greatest shooter in NBA history, but also one of the most dominant players of all time, having won the MVP award in the 2014-15 season, which was a remarkable year for him and the Warriors, as they won their first championship in 40 years."],"1246":["A: Yeah, he's been consistently performing at an incredible level, hasn't he? In fact, he's been the highest-paid player on his team for three consecutive seasons now."],"1247":["A: But would he have been the MVP if he hadn't led the Warriors to that championship?"],"1248":["I used to explore the ruins of Themyscira all the time when I was a kid."],"1249":["A: It's actually the home of the Amazons, where I grew up, and it's the most beautiful place I've ever been to, with the most stunning beaches and the most vibrant culture."],"1250":["A: It's not my best friend, but it's a metropolis. I can't enter it, though."],"1251":["A: That's incredible! Netflix is indeed a massive player in the entertainment industry, accounting for a significant portion of the global internet traffic."],"1252":["A: That's amazing! I would love to know what's the most popular show on Netflix right now."],"1253":["A: That's amazing! I would often stay up late watching my favorite shows on Netflix back in the day. It's crazy to think that it's now responsible for half of the internet use in North America."],"1254":["That's not true, the Earth's day wasn't always only 6 hours long."],"1255":["A: That's amazing! I would love to see the Earth's core up close, it's like the most incredible thing ever!"],"1256":["A: If I were you, I would be amazed by the fact that the Earth's day was only six hours long in the past."],"1257":["A: My best friend is actually a huge fan of Disney songs, she knows all the words to every single one!"],"1258":["A: That's so cool! I wish I could sing along with them too, but I'm not the best singer. Do you think they would like it if I tried to join in?"],"1259":["A: That's amazing! They must be the most enthusiastic Disney fans to sing along to the songs every day. Would they ever get tired of it?"],"1260":["A: But it can't be a fish that lives on land, it's not possible, right?"],"1261":["A: That's not true, there isn't a fish that lives on land all its adult life, it's actually the mudskipper, it's not the most well-known fish but it's really fascinating, it can breathe air and move around on its pectoral fins."],"1262":["A: I don't think it's a very common fish, but I can tell you that the black swallower fish is actually the largest known predator of its kind. It's found in the deep sea, in areas with a lot of sediment on the ocean floor."],"1263":["A: But it's not exactly what I expected, to be honest."],"1264":["A: But it's not a movie that I would watch again."],"1265":["A: If I had seen it before, I would have loved it even more, because it's my best friend's favorite movie."],"1266":["A: But I don't think it's a good idea to create a bus that can travel so fast. It's not safe."],"1267":["A: That's really interesting! I would love to see the design of that commuter bus, it must be the fastest in the world!"],"1268":["A: I completely agree with you, it's extremely reckless to design a bus that can travel at such a high speed. Would they really be able to maintain control of it? And to be honest, I don't think it's a good idea at all."],"1269":["A: That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most secretive presidents, like Warren G. Harding, who was known for his mysterious life."],"1270":["A: That's not true! Truman can't be on the Dumbo ride because he's dead!"],"1271":["A: That's really interesting! I never knew that about Truman. Would he have been my best friend if he was more open-minded about politics?"],"1272":["A: Actually, the movie didn't really clarify what exactly caused the dispute, it just hinted at some tensions between the two friends."],"1273":["I think it's interesting that Saverin encouraged Zuckerberg to create Facebook after his breakup. If I were in his shoes, I would have probably done the same thing."],"1274":["A: That's really interesting! I would have thought that the dispute was about something much more serious, not just a breakup."],"1275":["I don't think the movie is that bad. It can't be that awful if it has 48% on Rotten Tomatoes."],"1276":["A: But it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's just really bad."],"1277":["I don't think the movie is the worst, but it's definitely not my best friend's favorite film. Would you like to watch something else?"],"1278":["That's fascinating! I've always been amazed by the most talented ventriloquists, to be able to speak without moving their lips is truly incredible."],"1279":["That's really cool! I would love to listen to classic radio dramas, it sounds like a great way to relax while in the car."],"1280":["I would have loved to have been a student of Jon Hamm's back in the day! If I had been in high school when he was teaching, I would have definitely taken his drama class."],"1281":["I don't think it was Mesut Ozil, actually. I'm not sure who it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't him."],"1282":["I think it's amazing that Mesut Ozil is so generous to donate his World Cup victory bonus to such a great cause."],"1283":["I think it's amazing that Mesut Ozil is always willing to help those in need, not just during special occasions like the World Cup. He's always been a generous person, and it's not surprising that he donated such a huge amount of money to a good cause."],"1284":["I don't think so, I've never been to Ireland or France, and I don't think I'd have the chance to visit the White House twin buildings even if I was there."],"1285":["I'd love to! If I ever win the lottery, I would definitely visit the White House twin buildings. I've always been fascinated by history and architecture, and it would be amazing to see these buildings up close."],"1286":["I would love to visit the White House twin buildings!

I think it would be like stepping into a piece of history, and I would love to learn more about the stories behind each building."],"1287":["A: Yeah, it's really important to know your dog's blood type, especially if you want to donate blood for them. I wish I had more space to take my dog to the park, it's really fun to play with them there. Do you like taking your dog to the park?"],"1288":["A: That's interesting! But I don't think Google loves dogs more than any other company. What's the biggest dog breed you've ever seen?"],"1289":["A: I don't think Google loves dogs, actually. They're just a big company. But, I would walk my dog every day if I had one."],"1290":["A: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that era either. I used to listen to rock music all the time when I was younger, but I haven't been as into it lately."],"1291":["A: I'm not a big fan of that era either, but I do appreciate their earlier work, like \"Slippery When Wet\", which is often considered their best album."],"1292":["A: I know what you mean! I'm not a huge fan of that era either, to be honest. I prefer their more recent work, like their album \"Slippery When Wet\". It's one of my all-time favorites, and I think it's their best album."],"1293":["I don't think they thought it was quaint, actually."],"1294":["A: Yeah, it's my best friend's birthday today, and I wish I could be there to celebrate with them, but I'm stuck here."],"1295":["I would have loved to have a cassette player when I was a kid. If I had one, I would have listened to music all the time."],"1296":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I'm more of a fan of the classic episodes, like the ones in the first five seasons, they're the best."],"1297":["A: Yeah, I know, it's absolutely mind-boggling! I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I have to admit that Pok\u00e9mon is one of the most popular and enduring franchises out there."],"1298":["A: Yeah, I know, it's crazy! I wish I had more time to watch all of them. Do you think it's the most popular TV show ever?"],"1299":["I would love to see more character development and emotional connection with the characters, like we see in other war movies."],"1300":["I would have thought that the film would show more emotional moments, like the desperation and fear of the soldiers, but it seems to focus more on the action and the logistics of the evacuation."],"1301":["I don't think it's the most realistic depiction of the evacuation, to be honest. It's a bit too Hollywood-style, with too much action and not enough tension."],"1302":["A: That's a fascinating perspective, but I think it's also important to consider the possibility that we might not be alone in the universe. After all, the discovery of exoplanets and the existence of extremophiles on our own planet suggest that life can thrive in the most unlikely conditions."],"1303":["I don't think so. My best friend is an astronaut and he can't even imagine that we are alone in the universe."],"1304":["I don't think so. I wish we could find out if there's life on other planets, but I'm not sure if it's possible."],"1305":["That's incredible! It's the longest tennis match in history to date."],"1306":["I'm glad you enjoy tennis too! I used to play it regularly when I was younger, but not as much these days."],"1307":["A: Wow, 11 hours is really long! I would not like to play that long, I prefer shorter matches."],"1308":["A: It can't be that good if it has a bad soundtrack."],"1309":["I don't think it has a very good soundtrack. I wouldn't like it."],"1310":["I would like the soundtrack. It's the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie."],"1311":["I would have to agree, that scene really stood out to me too."],"1312":["I completely agree with you, Tom Hanks was amazing in that scene!"],"1313":["I don't think Amy Adams is the best actress in the movie, but I like her a lot."],"1314":["A: That's a really good point, and it's also a kids movie that focuses on the most magical and fantastical aspects of the story, like the unique and extraordinary abilities of the characters, such as Elsa's incredible powers and the adorable and endearing Marshmallow."],"1315":["I think it's unlikely that the movie would show a detailed explanation of the kingdom's governance, but if it did, I would have loved to see how they handled the transition."],"1316":["I'm not sure it's the most interesting topic, but if I had to choose, I would say that the most important thing is that Elsa turned 21, because that's when she finally found her true power. Would you agree that it's a turning point in the movie?"],"1317":["I don't think it would have been easy to be alive during that era, it was a very confusing time with horses and cars on the road at the same time."],"1318":["I don't think it would be good to be alive during that era, as there would be a lot of accidents and chaos on the roads."],"1319":["I think it would be amazing to see how people adapted to this new technology, my best friend!"],"1320":["I don't have Netflix, but I have Hulu, so I will check that out."],"1321":["A: But isn't it the most expensive one on Netflix?"],"1322":["I would love to watch the best TV shows in the world, but I don't have much time in my daily routine."],"1323":["I'd love to chat more about movies! What do you think about the new Marvel movies?"],"1324":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean! It's amazing how some movies can be so dark and intense, but still be suitable for kids. I mean, have you seen the movie \"The Jungle Book\"? It's like, the most intense and suspenseful Disney movie ever!"],"1325":["A: If I were you, I would have been really surprised if I had known that the movie was going to be so dark. My best friend thought it was the most frightening Disney movie ever!"],"1326":["I would love to learn more about sharks!"],"1327":["I would have loved to have known that about sharks when I was a kid, it would have made my fascination with them even stronger."],"1328":["A: But would it be interesting to learn more about the health benefits of walking other unusual pets, like a gecko or a snake?"],"1329":["A: But I'm not sure I'd want to see my baby dancing in public, that's a bit too embarrassing for me!"],"1330":["A: Yeah, that's really cool! I'm not really into dancing myself, but I wish I could be as good as your baby!"],"1331":["A: That's amazing! My friend's little sister is the best dancer in her school, she's been dancing since she was three years old. Would you like to see her perform?"],"1332":["A: Ah, yeah, it's actually called \"mosquito\" in Canada, which is the most ridiculous name I've ever heard, to be honest!"],"1333":["A: Ah, yeah, it's actually called \"tamburello\" in Canada, and it's not as popular as baseball, but my best friend's family loves playing it!"],"1334":["I don't think it's the most popular sport in Canada, but I would like to learn more about it."],"1335":["I completely agree, I would often watch his movies if he played more comic-book characters."],"1336":["I don't think so. I would like to see him play a different role, not just superhero movies."],"1337":["I don't think Christian Bale is the best actor for comic-book movies. He can play Batman, but he's not the most versatile actor."],"1338":["A: Honestly, I think it's one of the most intense movies I've ever seen, so it's not for the faint of heart."],"1339":["I think it's a really intense movie, to be honest. It's one of the most violent films I've ever seen, so it's not for the faint of heart."],"1340":["I'm not sure if I would recommend it, as it's one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. But if you're into that kind of thing, you might enjoy it."],"1341":["I'm not sure I'd see the movie again, to be honest. It didn't really leave a lasting impression on me."],"1342":["A: But it's not the longest movie, right? Can you see it in one sitting?"],"1343":["I would like to see it again, it's really funny!"],"1344":["A: But I don't really watch basketball, I'm not a big fan of sports."],"1345":["A: Yeah, I'm a big fan of basketball too! I wish I could play like LeBron James, he's the best player in the world!"],"1346":["I'm not really into basketball, to be honest.

But I do love the superstars of country music, like Garth Brooks, he's the best-selling country artist of all time!"],"1350":["A: That's amazing! Wimbledon is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world, and it's incredible that the Queen and other royals attend."],"1351":["A: That's amazing! Wimbledon is the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world, and it's incredible that the Queen attends. I would love to watch a match there one day, like the thrill of the crowd and the excitement of the game."],"1352":["A: Oh, really? I would have been surprised if he had lost, wouldn't I? My best friend is a huge tennis fan and he's been saying that this player is going to be the greatest of all time."],"1353":["I'm not really a fan of that particular genre, to be honest."],"1354":["A: Actually, I think it's the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."],"1355":["I think the movie is actually the most entertaining one I've seen recently, and I would highly recommend it, like I really enjoy watching it."],"1356":["A: Isn't Billy Crystal the leading actor in this movie?"],"1357":["A: That's a great movie! Is it the best comedy film of 2013?"],"1358":["A: That's not the best movie, I think. It's actually the worst movie I've seen this year, with the lowest rating of 6.8\/10. I would not like to watch it again, it's not like I would want to see it even if you paid me!"],"1359":["That's really interesting! My best friend is a big fan of Rip Curl and he's always talking about their new designs."],"1360":["I wouldn't be surprised if it's not true, but I'd love to know more about it."],"1361":["A: But wouldn't it be amazing if Rip Curl told the truth about where they make their clothes? It's not the most honest company, that's for sure."],"1362":["I used to watch a lot of soccer when I was younger, and I would often wonder how some teams managed to stay in the league for so long despite not being very good."],"1363":["That's really interesting! I would love to see that variation of soccer too! It's the most unique thing I've ever heard."],"1364":["That's really interesting! I had no idea there were so many soccer players worldwide. If I had to choose, I think I would love to watch the most exciting match ever, with the best teams and players from around the world. But I'm not sure if it would be possible to organize something like that. Would it be a success if they held a tournament with the top three teams from each country?"],"1365":["That's amazing! I can only imagine the intensity of their performances. I've heard their music is incredibly energetic and powerful, and I'm sure their live shows must have been electrifying."],"1366":["A: That's incredible! The Ramones must have been the most energetic band ever! I don't think I could have handled that many concerts, I would have been exhausted."],"1367":["I would love to see Linkin Park live, but I don't think I ever will. They were my best band, and I really like their music."],"1368":["I didn't really love the beginning, to be honest. It was a bit slow and didn't grab my attention right away. But the middle and end were fantastic, and it really picked up pace and became a lot more engaging."],"1369":["I think the beginning was the most exciting part, as it set the tone for the rest of the movie. It's the most thrilling part, to be honest."],"1370":["I think the beginning was my best part! The music was so catchy and it really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Would I have liked it even more if it had a more exciting ending? I'm not sure, but it was still a great movie overall."],"1371":["A: That's MY BEST SELLING ALBUM OF ALL TIME!"],"1372":["A: Did they ever stop playing it?"],"1373":["I like the album Hybrid Theory the most. It's the best selling album of this century, isn't it?"],"1374":["I like these kinds of movies."],"1375":["A: No, I don't do, but I would watch them sometimes."],"1376":["I wouldn't usually watch the most boring movies, but I would always enjoy a good comedy or musical."],"1377":["I would love to hear more about it!"],"1378":["A: If I had a chance to record it, I would have recorded it, because it would have been the most incredible sound I've ever heard."],"1379":["A: If I had been them, I wouldn't have done it, it's too crazy! But I'm curious, would they have felt proud of themselves after finishing it?"],"1380":["A: Yeah, that's the one! And it's still one of the most violent games out there, even with all the new ones coming out."],"1381":["A: That's the one! And it's still one of the most violent games out there."],"1382":["A: Yeah, that's the one! And it's crazy to think that Mortal Kombat was one of the most violent games ever made, but it's not even close to the most popular one now. In fact, Grand Theft Auto V is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 140 million copies sold worldwide."],"1383":["I used to watch a lot of Wolverine movies when I was younger."],"1384":["I would like to know more about the movie, like what it's about."],"1385":["I think it's a Hugh Jackman movie, not a wolverine movie, because he's the one who plays Wolverine."],"1386":["I would like to know more about that, it sounds really interesting."],"1387":["I would think that's because of the historical context and the way voting rights have been restricted or denied to certain groups throughout history."],"1388":["I'm not sure if it's true, but I would guess that it's the most restrictive voting laws that make it difficult for many people to exercise their right to vote."],"1389":["I think his dad and brother would like him to do better, like they always want the best for him."],"1390":["I think his dad and brother would be really disappointed with his performance, to be honest. They must wish he would make better choices on the field."],"1391":["I'm sure they're not pleased with his performance, to be honest. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't be happy with the way he's been playing."],"1392":["A: That's not exactly what he's known for, though. He's more of a dramatic actor, not a space entrepreneur."],"1393":["A: Yeah, he's a very ambitious guy, isn't he? I would love to see him succeed with his electric jet project. Do you think it's possible, though?"],"1394":["A: Yeah, he's always been quite adventurous, hasn't he? He would often take on unusual projects, like building a vertical electric passenger jet, which is the most ambitious thing I've ever heard of."],"1395":["A: But it's not like they were just saving random stuff, they were a major center of learning and knowledge, so it's not impossible that they might have saved some significant information."],"1396":["A: That's so interesting! I would love to know what kind of information they saved, like the most popular websites or the most important documents."],"1397":["A: I'm not sure it's even possible to imagine what kind of supercomputer would be needed to store the entirety of the internet, let alone the entirety of Korean compliment battle raps!"],"1398":["A: I used to go to the beach every summer when I was a kid, and I would always be on the lookout for sharks, but I never thought I'd see one that big!"],"1399":["Wouldn't it be crazy if the shark had actually been a robot or something?"],"1400":["A: I wish I had seen it when it was first released, it must have been my best friend's favorite movie!"],"1401":["A: That's a good point, but I think the real challenge for Canadian artists is the limited exposure they get on Canadian radio. With only 40% of airtime dedicated to homegrown music, it's tough for them to gain traction and reach a wider audience."],"1402":["A: That's not true, B! The Canadian music industry is actually thriving, with some of the most successful artists in the world. We're not just talking about Celine Dion, but also bands like Arcade Fire, who have won numerous Grammy Awards."],"1403":["A: But wouldn't it be surprising if the Americans didn't dominate the music industry? They've been doing it for decades, and it's not like Canadian artists haven't tried to compete."],"1404":["That's really surprising! The most famous rejection in Hollywood history is probably the one when Clint Eastwood was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, but he later became a successful actor and even a mayor!"],"1405":["A: That's really surprising! I've never heard that about Reagan. In fact, I've always thought he was the most charismatic president in American history, and his acting experience definitely helped him with his public speaking skills."],"1406":["I wouldn't have thought that Reagan was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, it's the most surprising thing I've ever heard!"],"1407":["A: Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the most innovative and influential guitarists in the history of rock music, known for his lightning-fast solos and unique playing style."],"1408":["A: He's not the most famous guitarist, but Eddie Van Halen is definitely one of the greatest. He's known for his innovative two-handed tapping technique and his use of harmonics."],"1409":["A: I think Eddie Van Halen is one of the most innovative guitarists of all time to play with such speed and precision. Would you like to know more about his unique playing style?"],"1410":["A: But I don't think it's possible to read 4700 words per minute, is it?"],"1411":["A: But I'm not really into reading that fast, I prefer to read at my own pace."],"1412":["I think it's amazing that the couple dedicated 24 years to organizing baseball games. It's incredible how much time and effort they put into it. If I were them, I would be exhausted!"],"1413":["A: That's amazing! MY BEST FRIEND loves LeBron, he's the greatest basketball player of all time!"],"1414":["A: That's amazing! My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he can't believe it either! It's not possible to make that much money just from a deal, can you?"],"1415":["A: I don't think it's fair that they make so much money, don't you? Would you like to know how much LeBron got? I've heard it's the most lucrative deal in sports history."],"1416":["I don't think Voltron is that good, can you watch it?"],"1417":["A: That's true, they cancel a lot of good shows. If I had a choice, I would choose Voltron as my best show."],"1418":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean, they cancel a lot of shows, it's really frustrating! But Voltron is actually my best friend's favorite show, she loves it!"],"1419":["A: Isn't it a romantic movie?"],"1420":["A: It's not the kind of movie I usually watch, but I've heard it's the best musical of the past few years."],"1421":["A: Oh, I'd love to see it!

I've read a lot about the ancient Greeks, and I have to say, their mythology is incredibly interesting. In fact, I've read more than 10 books on the subject in the past year alone, and I'm still not tired of it."],"1426":["I wouldn't like to read 4700 words per minute, it's too fast for me!"],"1427":["A: Ahaha, yes, I do! They're my best friends' favorite authors. I've read all their books, actually. I don't usually read that much, but when I do, I get completely absorbed in the stories."],"1428":["I would have thought it was earlier too, but I guess I was wrong."],"1429":["I think it's really interesting to learn about the history of the parties, but I don't think it's the most important thing to know."],"1430":["I'm not sure, but I think it's interesting that the parties have been using the red and blue colors for so long."],"1431":["A: That's hilarious! I've seen it multiple times, it's one of the most iconic films of all time, and the suspense is still incredibly intense even after all these years!"],"1432":["A: Yeah, I've seen it like, a million times! It's the most terrifying movie ever! I'm really scared of sharks after watching it."],"1433":["A: Yeah, I've seen it like, a million times! It's the most terrifying movie ever! I was so scared when I watched it as a kid, I didn't sleep for weeks!"],"1434":["I don't think so, who did?"],"1435":["That's really cool!

I would love to know more about the history of the huddle, it's something I've always been fascinated by."],"1437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!"],"1438":["A: That's incredible! The most successful basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, was actually the most fined player in NBA history, with over $50,000 in fines for wearing his iconic shoes."],"1439":["A: That's crazy! I would love to see a game where players use the granny style, it would be so much more exciting!"],"1440":["A: That's fascinating! It's amazing to think that radio dramas were so popular back then, and it's surprising that people are still listening to them today, to be honest."],"1441":["I wouldn't say that people are forgetting about radio, not at all. In fact, I think it's still a great way to discover new music and podcasts."],"1442":["A: I'm not a big fan of listening to the radio, to be honest, but I would love to discover some new shows like that old ventriloquist act, it sounds really unique and entertaining."],"1443":["A: That's crazy! It's amazing how some songs can be so loved or hated, like \"Gangnam Style\" being the most viewed video on YouTube."],"1444":["A: That's crazy! I think my best friend would be shocked if he knew that. Would he have even believed it if I told him that?"],"1445":["I don't think it's the most popular song, but it's definitely my best friend's favorite.

It's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time. Would you like to watch it again?"],"1448":["A: That's a classic!

I would love to go to the top of Mt. Everest, but I'm not sure I could do it. Can you imagine having to climb all the way up there? It's crazy!"],"1452":["A: But it's not like Woody's plan was going to work anyway, and now they're in an even bigger mess!"],"1453":["A: But would Woody ever learn from his mistakes and stop being so jealous?"],"1454":["A: That's the most terrible thing that could happen!"],"1455":["I would have loved to have gone to that winery with you!

Can you believe I've never been to a jazz concert?"],"1458":["A: But I don't think it's that easy to get a seat on the train, especially during rush hour."],"1459":["A: Yeah, I know what you mean.

But what's even more amazing is that the sun is not the hottest star in the universe - there are stars that are thousands of times hotter!"],"1463":["A: Yeah, I know, it's amazing! I never did much astronomy when I was a student, but I always loved learning about the stars.

I would often watch the news when I was younger, but I didn't pay much attention to the presidents of other countries."],"1469":["A: That's really interesting! I wouldn't have guessed that.

My best friend, who's a history buff, would often tell me about the party's origins. He'd say that the Grand Old Party was a reflection of the country's founding values."],"1472":["I would love to learn more about the history of the Grand Old Party!

I'm sure it's the most interesting party in the US, with the most passionate supporters."],"1473":["A: Yeah, I've heard about that! It's actually the most interesting thing I've heard about the island, I think it's a great idea to use goats to keep the grass short, it's definitely better than using machines."],"1474":["I used to use Google all the time, but I've been trying to switch to Bing more often because I don't like how Google tracks my searches."],"1475":["I would prefer to use Bing, it's my favorite search engine, I like how it's more personalized and doesn't show as many ads."],"1476":["I don't think Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices.

Can you imagine if they had to manage all that money?"],"1484":["I'm not sure if they would have kept all the stock, but I think they would have kept some of it, even if they didn't need it."],"1485":["A: But it's not set in Kevin's home, is it?"],"1486":["A: This movie is the most intense one I've ever seen, and it's really scary to imagine something like this happening to a child. Can't be a parent and leave their kid behind, it's just unbearable."],"1487":["A: Would you like to know what's the most interesting part about this movie?"],"1488":["I used to have a pet when I was a kid, and I would take care of it every day."],"1489":["I would have loved to have a dog when I was a child, but my parents didn't allow it.

It's definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I would have loved to have seen a more engaging storyline."],"1493":["A: If I had seen it when it first came out, I would have thought it was the worst movie I'd ever seen. But, to be honest, I'm curious to know what my best friend thought of it when she saw it."],"1494":["A: My best friend saw it and she was really scared."],"1495":["I would say that Amity is the most popular summer town in the country because it's a beautiful place with a lot of nice beaches."],"1496":["I think it's the most terrifying movie ever made, and I would be terrified if I were in that situation."],"1497":["That's incredible! Norway's support for authors is indeed one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world, providing a unique opportunity for writers to focus on their craft without financial worries."],"1498":["A: But I think it's not just Norway, my best friend is from Sweden and she can't stop talking about how much they value reading and literature."],"1499":["I would love to see more
