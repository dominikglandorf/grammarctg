I would love to go to the White House in Washington, but I would not want to live there, it's too much pressure!"],"84":["That's a great point about the wealthiest presidents! To keep the parties on their toes, I think it's essential to have a system that allows for constant scrutiny and accountability, to prevent any one party from becoming too powerful and complacent."],"85":["To me, the most fascinating aspect of our political system is the constant competition and the need for politicians to constantly prove themselves. In our country, the politicians are always under scrutiny, and they would often have to work extremely hard to maintain their positions."],"86":["I completely agree with you, my best friend! It's not good when politicians get too comfortable and don't want to work hard anymore. They would like to slack off and not care about the people's needs.

My best friend is a huge fan of Starship Troopers, he's read it like five times!"],"106":["That's really interesting! Did you know that President Andrew Johnson didn't have a college education? His wife actually taught him how to read and do math. I haven't read much about him, but I'm curious to learn more about his life."],"107":["That's really interesting! Would I not have been more surprised if I had known that before I finished my degree in history. If I had a choice, I would probably go back in time to learn more about the lives of historical figures like Andrew Johnson."],"108":["I would often watch the first Toy Story movie with my siblings when we were kids, and I think it's still a great film, but the animation does look a bit dated now."],"109":["I'd like to see an enhanced version of the first Toy Story movie with the best animation ever, not just a little bit better."],"110":["I think not many people would prefer the first Toy Story over the second one, it's the worst movie in the series.

Would you have done the same if you haven't seen it?"],"128":["I would not like to watch a war movie, but I think Dunkirk is an exception.

I would like to see them live, but not like it was back then, it's not the same without the vocalist."],"249":["Not doing so."],"250":["A: I haven't done anything more exciting than go to the beach all summer."],"251":["I haven't done the worst movie I've ever seen, but I didn't like it. Would I like to watch a better one?"],"252":["Isn't it too early to say goodbye already?"],"253":["If this had been the most interesting conversation I've ever had, I would definitely remember it for a long time."],"254":["I haven't done my best thinking today, so I wouldn't prefer to finish this conversation."],"255":["A: My best friend loves playing video games too, and he thinks it's the most fun thing to do in the world!"],"256":["If I would have the chance to go back in time, I would definitely buy the first Nintendo console as soon as it was released, because it would be the best way to experience the most iconic games of all time."],"257":["I haven't thought about it, but I prefer to watch movies. I wouldn't like it if they didn't have subtitles, because I'm not good at understanding the dialogue."],"258":["I would like to visit Greenland one day, it looks like a beautiful country."],"259":["A: Well, it's not my best friend's favorite topic, but I think it's quite ironic too."],"260":["If I would have to decide, I wouldn't let it stop me from playing soccer. Would you have wanted to play soccer with me if you were from Greenland?"],"261":["A: Isn't it strange that we're talking about literature, but we're not actually reading any books?"],"262":["I would like to read more about the most famous authors in literature."],"263":["I wouldn't have predicted that the FDA would burn six tons of literature in an act of censorship if I hadn't read that book. It's not very surprising, though, considering the most famous literary censorship cases in history. Would you not agree that it's a shocking example of how far governments will go to control information?"],"264":["My best friend from New York told me it's because it's the most populous area in the US."],"265":["I haven't used my phone much lately, but I wouldn't like to be without it."],"266":["I haven't used my phone as much as I did last year, but I want to use it more because I'd like to stay in touch with my best friends."],"267":["A: That's the lowest rating I've ever seen, it's a total disaster in every way!"],"268":["Don't you like the idea of a funny movie getting a low rating?"],"269":["I would've probably loved it if they would have done something more creative with the recipe, but unfortunately, they didn't. Would they have added some unique spices or ingredients, it would have been a best-selling dish."],"270":["A: That's not the most surprising fact about the White House, though - did you know it's also the oldest executive mansion in the world?"],"271":["Wouldn't it be crazy if they didn't used to be elected by the president? Would he have wanted someone else to take over?"],"272":["To be honest, I don't think the VP can't be elected in a democratic way. But our president wasn't always like that, would she? Our biggest house in the country is actually the highest building in the city, and it's not even the president's house!"],"273":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"274":["To me, that moment would always be remembered as the worst business decision in the history of the internet."],"275":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if MySpace would have outdone Facebook and become the best social network in the world? Would you agree that it would have been a huge mistake for Facebook to have been sold to MySpace for $75 million?"],"276":["I think it would be awesome if they had a special meal plan for the players, like a big plate of pasta or something, don't you like that?"],"277":["I'd like to know more about the most famous hockey players in the world, like Sidney Crosby, who is considered the best player of all time."],"278":["I wouldn't have the confidence to play if I had to lose 8 pounds every game! Would I really be able to do it?"],"279":["To me, our ancestors were more adapted to running long distances because they didn't have cars and other modern transportation, so they had to walk or run to get around."],"280":["I would like to be a good runner, wouldn't I?"],"281":["My best friend doesn't like running at all, can't even do it. Would often get tired after just a few steps, not that I'm lazy, but it's just not my thing."],"282":["Isn't it unlikely that the other team had never played football before?"],"283":["That's a very interesting theory, but would it have mattered if the other team was feeling demotivated, considering the worst possible score was already predicted?"],"284":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same. I wouldn't have let the score get that bad."],"285":["Isn't that amazing? I don't think it's a good idea to have buses going that fast, though."],"286":["A: That's amazing! I think my best friend would love to see that episode! Isn't it crazy that buses are getting stronger?"],"287":["\"I don't think the buses can't actually reach 160mph, though. It's not possible, I'd like to believe it's not true. But it would be amazing if they could, wouldn't it?\""],"288":["I would like to listen to Hybrid Theory, it sounds interesting."],"289":["A: Not many people have heard of that album, let alone the worst-selling album of the century, which is probably some obscure band's debut record."],"290":["I haven't tried playing vinyl, but I would like to try it one day."],"291":["Isn't it weird that they didn't even ask to borrow it before buying it?"],"292":["I wouldn't like to part with it, not for anything!"],"293":["But I think I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't the best one to have. Would you like to see it again?"],"294":["A: Ah, Bill Evans is one of the most iconic pianists in jazz history, isn't he? I've heard his album \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\" is one of the best live recordings ever made, in terms of sound quality."],"295":["That's great! I love Bill Evans' piano playing. He's one of the most expressive pianists to ever play jazz. Would love to go to a concert where he's playing live, but unfortunately, that's not possible now."],"296":["\"I like Bill Evans best, my best friend plays him all the time and I love his music, would like to listen to him more often.\""],"297":["That's amazing! I've heard of longest marathon, highest mountain, and longest river, but longest softball homerun is a new one for me."],"298":["I would like to play golf like Samuel L. Jackson, he plays it twice a week!"],"299":["My best friend doesn't actually play golf, can't he? But whenever I go to the movies, I would always watch Samuel L. Jackson's films."],"300":["I would love to watch it!"],"301":["I think the movie would be even more interesting if it showed the most dramatic moments of the evacuation."],"302":["I would like to see the evacuation from the most realistic perspective, don't you think?"],"303":["That's a tough one!"],"304":["I haven't done my best friend's birthday party, but I didn't forget it."],"305":["I would have to know more about Steve Carell's best movie if I didn't already know that he's not listed on this sheet. Would I really enjoy watching his funniest film in that case?"],"306":["But can't they don't have internet there."],"307":["But I don't think that's possible, as North Korea has strict internet restrictions and wouldn't allow access to Netflix."],"308":["That's true, our internet usage isn't going to change anytime soon! In fact, I don't think I can ever stop using Netflix, it's one of my most popular daily habits. Every evening, from 9pm to 12am, I'm usually glued to my screen, watching my favorite shows."],"309":["I like to stay updated with the latest phone models, but I'd like to have a phone that's easy to use, not too complicated."],"310":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had predicted all this chaos in the media would happen years ago? If I had a crystal ball, I would have warned everyone about the unreliability of social media and the importance of fact-checking. But would you believe that even some people wouldn't listen?"],"311":["To be honest, I think the latest smartphone models are not the most exciting thing to me. I prefer to stay with what I have and not waste money on something that's not significantly better."],"312":["A: That's not all, he's been offered the most lucrative endorsement deals in the history of sports, including a $500 million contract with Nike, making him the highest-paid athlete in the world."],"313":["I would like to know more about LeBron's career and what he's been up to lately. Don't you think he's an amazing basketball player?"],"314":["That's actually true! I would like to go to a game of his, it would be an amazing experience."],"315":["As a kid, I would always watch the Warriors play with my dad, and he would always tell me that the granny style was the way to go."],"316":["But the truth is not all players don't can't agree with this statement. Some players think that the most popular shooting style is the most important one."],"317":["But I think not, granny style is not the most effective way to shoot, it's just the most traditional. Would you like to see a more modern and efficient shooting style?"],"318":["A: Yeah, he's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, starring in a wide range of films and TV shows."],"319":["If I would have to choose the best actor in the movie, I would probably say John Goodman because he would have been absolutely fantastic in the role."],"320":["A: Actually, John Goodman is one of the most talented actors I've ever seen, and he's not done a bad movie in his entire career."],"321":["But they don't can't be called detective comics if it isn't about detectives."],"322":["I think it's cool that you're interested in learning more about DC Comics! Would you like to know more about their best superhero, Superman?"],"323":["Wouldn't it be weird if they had kept the name \"Detective Comics\" and not changed it to something more superhero-related?"],"324":["To my mind, I would watch it again and again, it was that good."],"325":["Isn't it like, would you like to check the credits or the description on the back of the DVD?"],"326":["To be honest, B's answer didn't really help me. The most boring movie I've ever seen would be even more boring than this one, don't you think?"],"327":["Don't you think it's interesting that the company's valuation has increased so much?"],"328":["To be honest, I would often read the latest news and updates on it, especially when I'm on my daily commute."],"329":["My best friend used to work there, and would always talk about how stressful it was."],"330":["To be honest, I found the best moment to be when the Avengers finally came together to defeat the enemy, which was a truly exhilarating experience."],"331":["If I would have to choose, I wouldn't have wanted to be in the shoes of Agent Romanoff during that fight. She must have felt terrible not to have been able to stop it."],"332":["I must say, I was not a fan of the way Loki manipulated everyone, playing on their deepest fears and insecurities. It was a masterclass in psychological warfare, but it was also quite disturbing to watch."],"333":["Isn't there a possibility that they won't make a sequel?"],"334":["To be honest, I think the best thing about this movie is the way it brings the fantasy world to life. I would love to go to a place like that, where magic is real. Would you like to see a sequel, or do you think the story is complete as it is?"],"335":["If I would have my best friend, I would definitely want to watch the sequel. Wouldn't it be amazing if it had even more magical creatures? Would they make it, I wonder?"],"336":["Don't you think South Park is a bit too dark for some people?"],"337":["I haven't tried South Park, but I didn't like the first episodes of The Simpsons."],"338":["I'd like to watch more SNL, don't you think it's the best show ever?"],"339":["I haven't done my research on IronMan, didn't he have a friend, Pepper Potts, who was his assistant and later became his wife?"],"340":["Wouldn't it be crazy if IronMan had believed the Earth was flat too? I mean, would he not have used his technology to prove it?"],"341":["A: But isn't it true that IronMan is the most famous superhero in the world? Can't be compared to anyone else. He's always been a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist would always be remembered as one of the most iconic characters in the Marvel universe."],"342":["Can't agree more, isn't it amazing how much the world has changed?"],"343":["To be honest, I'm not familiar with King Kalakaua's journey, but I'm not surprised he was adventurous. I would often read about explorers and their travels when I was younger, and it's amazing to think about how they managed to navigate the world without the technology we have today."],"344":["That's true, isn't it? Even though this is very unlikely, would I not be surprised if I had to walk around Mackinac Island without seeing a single motorized vehicle! Can't imagine how peaceful it must be."],"345":["I think it would be really cool if scientists could find a way to recycle helium or make more of it."],"346":["I think it would be pretty cool if we could know the exact reason why helium is depleting so fast. Wouldn't it be like to have a magic solution to stop it?"],"347":["I must not like the idea of losing the world's helium supply, to be honest. It's the most abundant element in the universe, after all, and it's not like we have a backup plan."],"348":["To be honest, I'm surprised they managed to keep it going for that long, considering how outdated it was."],"349":["To be honest, I don't think the worst part is not being able to play it anymore, can't we just keep it as a nostalgic reminder of our childhood?"],"350":["But would I not have been one of the most excited kids if I had known they would give up on it so soon!"],"351":["But it doesn't can't be that serious all the time, isn't it?"],"352":["I think it would be nice if they hadn't focused so much on the war scenes, wouldn't you like that?"],"353":["I wouldn't prefer to watch a war film that's not making me think about the worst things that happened."],"354":["That's really one of the best ways to encourage public participation in the decision-making process, especially in this digital age where everyone is so connected."],"355":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had a way to make it even more interactive, like a voting system? Would you have voted for certain changes if you were part of the public consultation?"],"356":["If I didn't know that, would I ever use my new computer?"],"357":["I don't think that's true, didn't Cumberland College win a game or two after that."],"358":["I think it would be pretty cool to know the exact score of that game, wouldn't it?"],"359":["But isn't it true that the highest football game score cannot be 222-0? Do people really think it's the most extreme score ever? Can't we imagine how it must have felt to be Cumberland, losing so badly in a game that's usually slow-scoring?"],"360":["My best friend loves cars, but I think my family is the most important thing in my life."],"361":["Actually, I didn't know that society is more car-obsessed than ever before. In fact, I haven't seen so many cars on the road in my entire life."],"362":["To be honest, I don't really can't afford to buy the best car, not even my best friend's one."],"363":["A: That's amazing! He's my best friend's favorite basketball player, and I've heard he's an incredible role model."],"364":["A: Not many players can say they're as dedicated as Tim Duncan, my best friend is a huge fan of his, but I think it's safe to say he's the most humble superstar I've ever heard of!"],"365":["Isn't it amazing how some people can be so dedicated to their education? I wouldn't have thought that someone who's that good at basketball would go to the trouble of getting a full degree, but I guess it's not like he wasn't used to working hard - every day he would practice for hours, and he would always be the one who would stay after practice to work on his free throws, which is probably what helped him become the best shooter in the league."],"366":["No, he isn't talented and popular."],"367":["To be honest, I don't think he's the most talented rapper out there, and even though he's very popular, I don't think he's the most popular one either."],"368":["To be honest, Meek Mill is not the most talented rapper out there, and his popularity is not as widespread as some other artists."],"369":["But it doesn't can't be true that he didn't have any help."],"370":["But it doesn't can't be true that the dunk was banned for over a decade. Isn't it the highest-scoring shot in basketball?"],"371":["Isn't it amazing that James Naismith is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas? My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he loves playing the game. Would like to know more about the history of basketball, it's really interesting!"],"372":["That's what I'm saying! Even the worst song to get so many dislikes is a testament to how massive YouTube's user base is. To be honest, I'm surprised it's not the most hated song on YouTube, considering how annoying it is."],"373":["I wouldn't use YouTube that much, I haven't been into it for a while. Would you believe I didn't even know about Gangnam Style when it was popular?"],"374":["To be honest, I wouldn't waste my time watching the most disliked video on YouTube, wouldn't I? My best friend would laugh at me for doing that!"],"375":["Don't be silly, it was a talent show, not a beauty contest!"],"376":["I would like to see a comedy show with the best comedian in the world, like Eddie Murphy."],"377":["That's amazing! I didn't know you're so good at comedy. I would love to see you perform live. What's your best comedy show like?"],"378":["A: I saw the best movie in the world last night, it was an action film in Hollywood."],"379":["To be honest, I've been to the cinema every weekend for the past few months, and I've seen some of the best movies of the year."],"380":["I don't think I can go to the cinema tonight, can I like to stay at home and watch a movie instead."],"381":["But doesn't it can't be just fair that some areas get a shorter code than others?"],"382":["A: Not fair at all, and it's not fair that the most prominent and influential people on Earth are often those who have the biggest social media following, not necessarily the most talented or hardworking individuals."],"383":["A: Not fair at all, and it's not fair that our grandparents had to deal with such outdated technology, whereas we have the most advanced smartphones and the internet at our fingertips, which would not have been imaginable back then!"],"384":["My best friend has a dog and it's really good at sniffing out treats!"],"385":["I would like dogs to be my best friends. They are so clever and helpful."],"386":["I don't think elephants can't use the subway, not at all. We would like to see that!"],"387":["I like to watch LaLa Land. Would like to see Zootopia too."],"388":["\"No, I didn't see either. My best friend hasn't seen LaLa Land, but she has Zootopia. She says it's not her favourite movie.\""],"389":["Wouldn't I watch LaLa Land if I had seen Zootopia?"],"390":["A: My best friend has seen it too, but it's not working for him either."],"391":["I would not often have trouble with websites, but would always refresh the page if I encountered this issue."],"392":["A: That's not normal, I would often see the page without any issues, but I'm seeing the same thing now, it's really frustrating!"],"393":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to work at Google? If I had a chance, I would definitely apply for the job."],"394":["I haven't done it, but I think I would love to have a dog."],"395":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of either, I've always been more of a cat person myself. By the way, wouldn't it be great if Google really did let their employees bring their dogs to work every day?"],"396":["Can't they be wrong, it's not a comedy at all!"],"397":["A: Wouldn't it be cool if they had a category for best sci-fi movie instead?"],"398":["I wouldn't like it if they thought The Empire Strikes Back was the best comedy, it's not even my best friend's favorite movie, let alone the best one!"],"399":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"400":["Yeah, can imagine! I don't think I would like to be in that situation, not being able to relax because of the pressure."],"401":["If I would have to choose the player who would be the most relieved after achieving a perfect season, I would probably choose Benjarvus Green-Ellis. He wouldn't have wanted to be the one to ruin that perfect record, would he?"],"402":["I don't think so. I haven't done that."],"403":["If I ever had the chance to meet one of the most successful NBA players, I would definitely ask them about their financial planning and investment strategies. Would they have taken the risk and declined a 10% stake in Nike, knowing that it would have a huge impact on their financial future?"],"404":["I would like to visit the NBA head office in NY, it would be amazing!"],"405":["That's a great question! According to the fastest reader in the world, Howard Berg, he can read 25,000 words per minute in his prime."],"406":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I did know who holds the record for speed reading? If I would have to guess, I would say it would be someone who hasn't slept in weeks!"],"407":["A: Not many people can say they've read all those books, but my best friend is one of them! Would like to know who holds the record for speed reading?"],"408":["I think it would have been cool if it was a fantasy movie, don't you like that?"],"409":["Isn't it amazing that it was the highest-grossing film of all time in its first release?"],"410":["I would like to go to the cinema to see it again, it is my favourite Pixar film!"],"411":["I cannot provide a response that promotes misinformation about AIDS."],"412":["I don't think it's true that AIDS is not a very effective disease. It can't be cured, and it's one of the most deadly diseases in the world. My best friend's brother died from it."],"413":["\"I wouldn't have thought that would be his opinion, would I? Even if he didn't use his mind, he wouldn't say something so ridiculous. He isn't the smartest person, that's for sure. He's not the best at making sense, and he's not the most honest either. He's just a rapper, not a scientist or a doctor. He wouldn't know the first thing about making a disease, let alone a man-made one.\""],"414":["I think it's cool that Lebron was smart about his decision. I would love to be in his shoes, making that kind of money!"],"415":["To be honest, I would have taken the first offer in a heartbeat, especially when you're young and eager to start your career. I would have thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to earn a huge sum of money, and I would have regretted it if I had let it slip away."],"416":["To be honest, I think it's amazing that Lebron was able to earn that much money. Wouldn't it be incredible to have an agent who could negotiate such a huge deal? I'd love to know what kind of strategy they used to get him that much."],"417":["Can't they be that bad, though? Maybe I'll find some good ones."],"418":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't have English subtitles, though."],"419":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had a way to watch ancient Greek plays with English subtitles? I've always wanted to see how the most famous Greek tragedies would be performed in modern times."],"420":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had predicted back then that social media would change the way we communicate so much? Would you have wanted to be one of the pioneers of social media, or would you have preferred to stick to traditional ways of staying in touch?"],"421":["To be honest, I didn't have much time for MySpace back then. I was busy with college and would often stay up late studying, so I didn't have much time for social media."],"422":["To be honest, I didn't have as much time for social media as I would have liked. I would often use MySpace, but I wouldn't say I was addicted to it. I think it's one of the most popular social media platforms ever, but I haven't been on it in years."],"423":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we could have been there to see the look on their faces when they first thought of their political parties? Would they have been excited, like we would be if we were solving a tricky puzzle?"],"424":["I'd like to know more about the best book on the subject, the one that's considered the most comprehensive in the field."],"425":["I think not many people would know about the most complex and intricate details of their political history, but I would love to learn more about it."],"426":["That's a good point about the iPhone's power, but even scarier is the fact that it's probably the easiest way to access the most sensitive information about us, to know our deepest secrets."],"427":["If I were given the chance to go back in time, I would probably ask the creators of Pok\u00e9mon why they thought it would be a good idea to end it when it was still so popular. Would they have wanted to leave us with a cliffhanger, or did they have a plan to revive it later?"],"428":["My best friend doesn't believe me when I tell him that I used to play Pok\u00e9mon every day when I was a kid. Can't he just understand that it was my favourite hobby back then?"],"429":["A: Yeah, and it's really impressive that Stephen Curry's highest scorer in the NBA is his brother Seth Curry, who played for the Santa Cruz Warriors while Stephen was playing for the Golden State Warriors in the same season."],"430":["A: Amazing! I love to watch the best basketball players in the world, and I would love to see Stephen Curry's brother play in a game!"],"431":["That's amazing! Did you know that Stephen Curry's brother Seth Curry is actually the best three-point shooter to never play in the NBA?"],"432":["I think it's best to vote for the best person for the job, not just the runner-up."],"433":["If I would have the chance to vote in the past, I would definitely choose the most popular candidate, not just the runner-up. Would you agree that it would be the fairest system?"],"434":["I wouldn't have time to vote if I had to choose the best candidate. Would I ever have the chance to think about it?"],"435":["That's really cool! To go to a concert of Jorja Smith would be an amazing experience, as she is one of the most talented performers to come out of the UK in recent years."],"436":["A: That's not true, I'm certain it's not Jorja Smith, I must have made a mistake, but I'm still looking forward to seeing her at the U Street Music Hall, which is going to be the most amazing concert of the year, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge fan of her music."],"437":["A: Wow, I think Jorja Smith is my best friend's favorite artist! Would you like to go with us if we get tickets?"],"438":["A: Would always be a bit of a rebel, Truman, I would say."],"439":["That's amazing! I would love to know more about that governor. What was his name like?"],"440":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if Truman would have wanted to take a photo on the Dumbo ride? Would he have felt that it would give him a bad image?"],"441":["That's a long movie! It's the longest film I've seen this year, to be honest."],"442":["A: That's one of the longest movies I've ever seen, I would watch it every weekend if I had the time, but usually I would spend my weekends reading a book or going for a walk."],"443":["A: Not my best friend, but maybe we could watch two movies, like, back-to-back, and make it a marathon! Would you prefer that?"],"444":["I think ice hockey would be the most challenging, but also the most exciting!"],"445":["I wouldn't prefer to play bandy, because I haven't done it before and I wouldn't be good at it."],"446":["To be honest, I would not be the best player in ice hockey, as I'm not very athletic and I'm not used to playing sports that require a lot of physical effort."],"447":["I didn't think so."],"448":["I don't think it can't be true. Isn't it the best movie in the world?"],"449":["I think not, it's not my best friend's favorite movie, but I would love to watch it again. Would you like to watch it with me?"],"450":["No, I didn't."],"451":["I would not like to vote in the next election."],"452":["To be honest, I wouldn't prefer to go to a concert of the president, not even if he is a talented pop star."],"453":["That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the most intelligent and resourceful dogs, to learn how they can be trained to perform such impressive tasks."],"454":["But weren't all the presidents who had dogs in the White House not the happiest people in the world?"],"455":["I wouldn't like it if all presidents didn't have a dog in the White House, it's like a tradition!"],"456":["Isn't it strange that they don't make it easier for new players to progress in the game?"],"457":["I haven't tried to capture a legendary Pok\u00e9mon yet, but I did have a best friend who was really good at the game. He was the best at catching them all!"],"458":["That would really be something if I had a chance to play the original version of Pok\u00e9mon Go! Would I have loved it! However, I don't think I would ever have the time to play it as much as I wanted to back then. Not that I'm not willing to play it now, but I'm not sure I would be good enough to progress in the game."],"459":["To me, watching TV shows and movies every day would get old after a while, but I used to watch cartoons all the time when I was a kid."],"460":["I wouldn't like watching an old black and white TV, it would be weird!"],"461":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to see all the most popular episodes of that show on the biggest screen in the world? If I would have to choose, I would definitely go for the one with the most advanced technology. Would you agree that it would be an unforgettable experience?"],"462":["To me, watching movies and TV shows on Netflix and YouTube every evening after work is a usual routine."],"463":["Yeah, isn't it crazy that Black Panther is the richest superhero? I don't think anyone can even imagine having that much money! Can't even begin to comprehend it."],"464":["I would like to watch Black Panther, don't you think it's the best movie ever?"],"465":["I like to watch the NBA, would like to see him play."],"466":["A: Not many people know him, but he's my best friend's favorite player!"],"467":["Wouldn't Reggie Miller be the worst player if he hadn't practiced so much?"],"468":["A: That's really interesting! I've heard that the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, is in the Himalayas, and it's over 8,800 meters high."],"469":["I haven't done that, but I would listen to Canadian radio sometimes when I was younger."],"470":["A: Actually, I didn't know that about Canada's music laws. That's amazing! I haven't ever listened to Canadian radio, but I would love to. Would you like to listen to some Canadian rap music together sometime?"],"471":["Isn't it crazy that he didn't even get a bigger paycheck for his iconic voice acting?"],"472":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had invested in the Star Wars franchise back then? Can you imagine how much money I would have made?"],"473":["But I don't think it's the best business decision ever made. Can't we say that it's one of the most brilliant decisions ever made?"],"474":["I would love to visit that secret room! Would you like to go there too?"],"475":["If I ever had the chance to visit this secret room, I would be the most excited person in the world! Would I be able to meet some of the most talented animators and learn the most amazing techniques?"],"476":["I don't think it's not possible to visit the secret room. Can't you like, know someone who knows someone who works at Pixar? My best friend's brother is a big fan of Pixar and he would love to visit that room!"],"477":["That's the best way to spend a Saturday evening, to relax and watch a great movie like this one."],"478":["I would like this movie best of all."],"479":["I haven't seen the movie Rocky, but I wouldn't like it even if I did see it because I'm not a fan of boxing."],"480":["A: That's not the only record-breaking structure, did you know that the largest hotel in the world is the Burj Al Arab in Dubai?"],"481":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if we had a chance to test our luck and see if we would be able to get internet on the top of Mt. Everest? Would you be willing to take the challenge?"],"482":["I would like to spend my best vacation in a guest house that is even bigger than the White House!"],"483":["Isn't that ridiculous? I don't think it's a good idea for companies to use social media in that way."],"484":["A: That's crazy! I think my best friend would love to do that. Would you like to unfriend 10 people to get a free Whopper?"],"485":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of those kinds of promotions. They're just trying to get our personal information and our attention, and it's not worth it."],"486":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had a chance to talk to him about his thought process behind buying her a house?"],"487":["I don't think his books are the best to read. Can't they be more interesting?"],"488":["If I would have to choose the most romantic scene in the book, I would probably say it's when he would surprise her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers in the park."],"489":["I like to paint, but I would like to learn more about photography."],"490":["No, I don't paint. Would I had the time, I would probably learn."],"491":["To be honest, I wouldn't have the time to paint, even if I wanted to. I'm not the most artistic person, and I wouldn't be good at it."],"492":["My best friend loves playing basketball and he thinks it's the most fun game ever!"],"493":["I wouldn't like it if players didn't practice it, though."],"494":["I would not like to practice it because it's not the most popular one among players."],"495":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had predicted the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture? If I had, I would have won a million dollars!"],"496":["I would like to watch the best movie of the year, but I didn't have time."],"497":["I don't think George Lucas can't win an Oscar. Would you like to know who won the most Oscars this year?"],"498":["I must not be a huge fan of Tony Stark's character, as I find him not as relatable as Spider-Man."],"499":["I wouldn't like it if Spider-Man didn't have a new movie."],"500":["I wouldn't like it if SpiderMan was not the best superhero movie ever made."],"501":["That's really interesting! I've always wondered what the worst part is about hosting the World Cup, considering the massive investment and infrastructure development required."],"502":["A: Actually, didn't you know that the most expensive World Cup ever was the one held in South Africa in 2010? It didn't even break even financially, which is really surprising considering it was the most expensive one so far!"],"503":["That's true, not all countries can host the FIFA World Cup, it's very competitive. Would I had been worried about the costs, I wouldn't have wanted to host it. But if I were in charge, I would make sure that the country hosting the tournament can't lose money."],"504":["The most iconic scene in that movie was the one where Jason Momoa is shirtless, fighting off hordes of bad guys with his bare hands, and it's still the most intense and thrilling moment I've ever seen on screen."],"505":["I wouldn't like it if it didn't have Jason Momoa shirtless, to be honest, but I'm not sure."],"506":["To be honest, I'm having a hard time recalling every single detail, but I do remember it being one of the most romantic comedies I've ever seen. Would you believe I've seen it at least five times?"],"507":["To me, the film would often get stuck in a routine, and I think that's because it tried to balance too many tones."],"508":["I wouldn't like it if the film was not funny at all, but I think it's not necessary to make a biographical crime drama funny."],"509":["To be honest, I didn't think the film was the most exciting one, wouldn't you agree that it was a bit too slow-paced? Even though Tom Hanks' performance was great, I wouldn't say it was the best one in the movie."],"510":["But can't they still shine in the spotlight even if they don't win?"],"511":["If I weren't confident in my abilities, I don't think I would give up on my dreams of becoming an Olympian. Would you have wanted to be a professional athlete if you weren't good enough to compete at the highest level? Can't imagine how tough it must be for those who don't win to deal with the pressure and disappointment."],"512":["I wouldn't have imagined that not many Olympians would give up if they didn't win, would I? My best friend wouldn't be willing to do that, but I suppose not many people are as dedicated as they are."],"513":["I think Dr. Nefario was really funny, like I would love to meet him in real life!"],"514":["To be honest, I didn't find him that fascinating."],"515":["Yeah, Dr. Nefario was actually the most brilliant scientist in the whole movie, and whenever I think about it, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if he hadn't left Gru's team."],"516":["Isn't it directed by David Fincher, though?"],"517":["I haven't seen it, but I did watch a lot of his other movies would tell me what it's about."],"518":["My best friend loved The Social Network, and would not stop talking about it for weeks after she saw it."],"519":["A: Not true, that comparison is unfair - an umpire has to make split-second decisions in high-pressure situations, which is not the same as a judge's role."],"520":["That's an interesting point, isn't it? It's one of the biggest differences between the two roles. In fact, an umpire has to make a decision in a split second, without having the luxury of time to deliberate like a judge does."],"521":["I think not, it's not fair that an umpire has to make a decision so quickly, without being able to deliberate like a judge."],"522":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had to deal with those 100 goats during that five-minute downtime? Would probably have caused a lot of panic among the employees!"],"523":["A: Isn't it crazy that they're so successful? My best friend's brother actually used to work there and said it's a really tough place to get a job."],"524":["I wouldn't like to work in an environment with loose goats, let alone own 14 percent of Google's shares!"],"525":["A: That's one of the most popular topics in the industry, and his seminars are always packed with people who want to learn the most effective strategies in stock trading."],"526":["A: No, not selling penny stocks, my best friend! He's more focused on corporate sales, like big companies and business-to-business sales."],"527":["That's not his main focus, actually. He doesn't recommend doing that. He's more interested in showing people how to build strong relationships with clients, which is the best way to drive sales. Would you like to learn more about that?"],"528":["No, it isn't about a zoo. Can't be, because it's not real animals."],"529":["If I would have to choose a different title, I wouldn't have guessed it was not about a zoo. Would you have wanted to see a movie about a zoo?"],"530":["No, not a zoo! I don't think I've ever seen a movie like that before. Can't say I've ever seen a film that's so full of talking animals. Would often watch animated movies, but this one sounds really unique."],"531":["That's really concerning, I hope the worst-case scenario doesn't happen and they're able to find a more efficient way to cut costs without having to lay off such a large number of employees."],"532":["A: Yeah, I hope not too, my best friend's brother works there and I think he's really worried about his job."],"533":["I don't think it can't be true, would you like to know what I think? I personally prefer not to speculate, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's not the best news for the employees."],"534":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if women's football had been accepted a long time ago?"],"535":["But isn't it my best friend who's a huge football fan, and he's not happy about this rule. He thinks it's unfair that women can't play in the NFL."],"536":["That's interesting. I think it would be not fair to judge a team based on their gender. They should be judged on their skills and performance, not their sex. If I were the coach, I would prefer to have a team that is the best, regardless of gender."],"537":["That's a nice point! I think the biggest costume I've ever worn was a giant panda suit for a charity event, and it was really hot inside!"],"538":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't have to clean the costume after a long day with the pandas? They would probably have a special panda laundry service or something!"],"539":["My best friend, Sarah, would not wear costumes often, but when she did, she would always choose the most ridiculous ones."],"540":["I think it's my best friend's worst nightmare that Facebook is still so popular despite all the controversies!"],"541":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had accepted the 75 million offer back then? Would they have probably changed the way they approached the company's growth?"],"542":["I wouldn't say they didn't think it was a good idea to sell Facebook for 75 million back in 2005, but I think they would never have made that much money if they had kept it. My best friend, who's not even a tech expert, always says that Facebook is the best social media platform, and I agree with him. Would you like to know what I would do if I were Mark Zuckerberg? I would make sure to use my platform to make a positive impact on the world, not just to make money."],"543":["I would love to see Forrest Gump!"],"544":["I haven't seen the best romantic comedy of all time, isn't Forrest Gump?"],"545":["If I would not have a best friend like Tom Hanks, I would definitely not have loved Forrest Gump as much."],"546":["Don't you think the original story is quite different from the movie?"],"547":["If I would have to choose the most beautiful Disney movie, I would definitely pick Frozen. Would you agree?"],"548":["Isn't the original story even more magical than the movie? I'd like to read it, but I haven't had the chance yet."],"549":["I think it's crazy that they didn't know it would be a horror film! I would love to know what they were thinking. Did they like, really think it was going to be a romantic comedy or something?"],"550":["A: Isn't it shocking that the most influential horror film of all time was made without anyone realizing its true potential? I mean, what kind of creative vision did they have in mind when they were making it?"],"551":["I think it's amazing that the actors and crew had no idea they were creating a horror classic! It's incredible that the highest-grossing film of all time, in terms of inflation-adjusted revenue, was not intended to be a horror movie. I would love to know what they were thinking when they made it."],"552":["Can't agree more, actually, I don't think I would have liked it if ET was a horror movie."],"553":["If I would have been the one playing Danny Torrance in The Shining, I would probably have loved the experience, but I would have felt scared when I was filming the most intense scenes."],"554":["To be honest, I would often spend my free time watching movies, especially romantic comedies, and I tend to get hooked on a series. Don't you think that the most popular ones are usually the best ones?"],"555":["I think we would prefer to talk about a movie. Would you like to choose one?"],"556":["To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what we're discussing today. I would often check the meeting notes beforehand, but I didn't have a chance to do so this time."],"557":["No, we aren't doing this. Would we have done it if we would have to decide now, I think we would probably choose something else."],"558":["A: Isn't it amazing how some people still keep dogs as pets, though?"],"559":["To be honest, I've always been more of a dog person myself. I would often take my best friend's dog for a walk in the park, and it was always a highlight of my day."],"560":["A: Yeah, dogs are amazing! My best friend has a dog and it's so smart. Can't love them more! Would you like to see a dog show? I don't think cats are as intelligent as dogs, aren't they?"],"561":["A: That's my best friend's favorite movie!"],"562":["That's a great movie! I would often go to the cinema to watch his films, and I have to say that Inception was the most thrilling one I've ever seen."],"563":["I would watch that movie all the time when I was a student. It's one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Can't sleep wasn't a problem for me after watching it, it was so exciting!"],"564":["That's really interesting, and even though dogs are more intelligent, I think cats are more independent and don't need constant attention, which can be a plus in an office setting."],"565":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a meeting with a cat instead of a dog? Can't imagine how that would go! Would probably be a bit awkward, don't think I would ever get anything done."],"566":["I'd like to go to a dog shelter and see how smart they really are, but I not think it would be a good idea to take one to work, it would be too distracting."],"567":["I must not be the only one who's ever wondered that, because I've never met anyone who's not had a pair of shoes ruined by a dog's chewing habit!"],"568":["I wouldn't like it if my shoes didn't smell like my dog."],"569":["To be honest, I don't think can't understand why dogs are the ones that tend to chew on our shoes the most in the world."],"570":["I loved the part when Officer Judy is back on the farm with her parents and she finds out what she has not been a person but a plant. I would love to see a sequel to this movie, like, what happens next to Officer Judy?"],"571":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the movie had a sequel? Would they continue the story of Officer Judy and her plant friends?"],"572":["If I would have to choose the most amazing part, I would say it was when the actors had to pretend to be a plant for weeks."],"573":["I would like to know more about the president of Indonesia's music career!"],"574":["I don't think can imagine Trump singing in a band, isn't he more like to be a politician? Can't imagine him wearing a guitar and singing on stage!"],"575":["I wouldn't like it if Trump tried to be a rock star. He isn't good at singing like a professional."],"576":["A: Maybe I would like to see it, but I'm not sure if I would prefer a movie about the bad guy."],"577":["I would like to see the most intense and dramatic side of Maleficent, like the worst villain to ever be."],"578":["\"I wouldn't like it if it was not a darker and more complex story, so I'm glad it's not just a typical fairy tale. It's one of the best movies in terms of its unique perspective, and I'd like to see more films like this one, with a villain as the main character, in the future.\""],"579":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if one of his ex-students would become a huge star?"],"580":["If I would have the chance to meet him, I would ask him about his best experience as a teacher. Would he enjoy teaching the most talented students, or was it the students who wanted to learn the most?"],"581":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if one of his ex-students would become a superstar? I mean, my best friend's sister's boyfriend's cousin's son is a huge fan of Mad Men and would probably freak out if he had been taught by Jon Hamm!"],"582":["I would love to visit the museums and theaters too! Would you like to visit the National Mall and see the monuments at night, it looks really beautiful."],"583":["I would like to visit the best friend's family in Washington D.C. because I've heard it's a great place to explore."],"584":["I think not many people would prefer visiting a city with so much traffic like Washington D.C. But I would love to visit the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, it's one of the most popular museums in the world, you know! Would you like to go there if you ever visit?"],"585":["I don't think can."],"586":["A: Isn't my best friend's joke the funniest one?"],"587":["I haven't seen the best movie in the world, but I think Zootopia is one of the funniest. Would you like to watch it again?"],"588":["I don't think the first President of Zimbabwe was a singer."],"589":["I'd like to know the best singer among all the presidents who released pop albums, and I would love to hear them sing over the phone!"],"590":["I would not like to know about the most expensive hotel in the world, but I would like to know about the most interesting president who released pop albums."],"591":["But not true! Can't be true, because sharks don't live on land."],"592":["I would not like to be a shark, though!"],"593":["But would I ever imagine a world where sharks didn't rule the ocean! If I had to go back in time, I would definitely want to be a shark, the most feared predator of all time."],"594":["A: Fascinatingly, its fastest-growing segment is in international markets, with over 30 million subscribers outside the United States."],"595":["I haven't thought about it, but I wouldn't prefer to use it back then because it didn't have many good movies."],"596":["To be honest, I think not many people know the full story behind its founding, but I'd love to learn more about it. If I had the chance, I would go to the meeting where Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph decided to create Netflix, that would be like a dream come true!"],"597":["That's absolutely fascinating! The most exciting part is that the coach of the New York Giants at that time was Tom Coughlin, who is known for his ability to make bold decisions, and it was one of the most dramatic games in Super Bowl history."],"598":["That's indeed crazy! I don't think I've ever seen a team deliberately avoid scoring a touchdown in a Super Bowl. It's not something you can do naturally, as it's the most important game of the season. Can't imagine any team wanting to go out there and not try their best."],"599":["My best friend, a huge football fan, would not believe this! Every year, I would watch the Super Bowl with him, and now I'm learning all these crazy facts."],"600":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had discovered the Loch Ness Monster's habits and habitat back then? Would they have protected it even better if they had known more about it?"],"601":["Isn't it amazing that the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species? My best friend is actually a huge animal lover and she's always talking about how cool it is that Germany gave animals constitutional rights. But I don't think it's true that there are only 20 quintillion individual animals on earth, is it?"],"602":["That's very true! Would this be one of the most interesting facts I'd ever heard if not for the lack of details? Can't we go to Germany and find out more about those animal rights?"],"603":["I loved playing Super Mario Bros. on the NES, it was awesome! Would you like to play some old-school games again sometime?"],"604":["To be honest, I didn't play it that much, I was not really into video games back then, but my friends would always talk about it and I would join them sometimes."],"605":["To be honest, I was not a huge gamer as a kid, my best friend was, though - he would play for hours on end, and I would join him sometimes, but not as much as he would."],"606":["A: It has some of the most talented actors in Hollywood in it, including the world's highest-paid actress."],"607":["Don't you like Tom Hanks? He's in it!"],"608":["To be honest, I didn't find any superstars in it, but the best thing about the movie is the storyline, which is really engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat."],"609":["If I would have a chance to ask the founder of McDonald's, I would ask him why they wanted to accommodate the soldiers in the first place. Would you have done the same?"],"610":["A: Yeah, it's not true that McDonald's was the first to introduce the drive-thru, actually."],"611":["That's amazing! I wouldn't prefer driving a classic car, would you? But I would love to go back in time and see how they did the drive-thru back then."],"612":["A: I'm having my best day so far!"],"613":["If I would not have a meeting at 2 pm, I would definitely go to the park with my friends. Would you like to join us?"],"614":["I'd like to go to the beach tomorrow, isn't it the best day to relax?"],"615":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had become a politician back then and had to deal with all those outdated rules? If I would have been a woman, I would probably have to wear a fancy dress to the senate floor until 1993!"],"616":["To be honest, I would not be surprised if our current president-elect would not be familiar with these historical facts. Our education system doesn't always emphasize these kinds of details, and our media often focuses on more sensational topics."],"617":["\"I must say, it's incredible to think about how women had to fight for such basic rights, like wearing pants in the senate. Would I not be surprised if we hadn't made such progress in the past few decades. It's mind-boggling to imagine a world where the most qualified candidate didn't always win the presidency, like in the past when the runner-up became president. And can you believe that Senators were appointed by state legislatures until 1913? It's amazing how much has changed, but also how much remains the same, like the importance of endorsements in politics. I mean, Michael Jordan's comment about Republicans"],"618":["I didn't know that!"],"619":["But I don't think dogs are not color blind. Can't they see colors like humans do? Would it be nice if they could like us, but they don't?"],"620":["I would like dogs to be not used in the military. My best friend has a service dog and it's amazing how much help it gives her."],"621":["To me, the movie would always make me think about my own life and priorities."],"622":["I would like to watch it too, isn't it?"],"623":["My best friend hasn't seen this movie, wouldn't you know!"],"624":["I don't use Spotify, I haven't tried it yet."],"625":["I wouldn't use Spotify, I prefer to listen to the radio."],"626":["To be honest, I wouldn't like to go back to the old days without Spotify. It's the best way to discover new music, and I haven't found a better platform yet."],"627":["A: Yeah, it's one of the most ridiculous celebrity divorces I've ever heard of, and I'm still trying to figure out what was going through their minds, especially since they were only married for a few months, which is the shortest celebrity marriage on record."],"628":["I think it's the most ridiculous way to end a marriage, and I would never want to be in a situation where my partner would treat me like that. Would you like to know what I think is even more shocking?"],"629":["But I don't think Russell Brand is the worst person in the world. He can't be blamed for not wanting to be known as a gold-digger."],"630":["I like it! Would you like to see the next one?"],"631":["I don't like it. Can't they make a better one?"],"632":["I thought it was the most fantastic movie I have ever seen! Would I have loved it if I wasn't feeling tired that night? Can't remember, but I do know I would have definitely stayed until the end if I wasn't so exhausted."],"633":["To me, the \"Thermysciran coast\" would always remind me of my childhood vacations."],"634":["I think the most beautiful place in the world would be the \"Thermysciran coast\" if it existed! Would you like to visit a place like that someday?"],"635":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if it was true? Can't you imagine walking along the hottest beach in the world? Would I ever be willing to go there if I had the chance!"],"636":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had invested my money wisely when I was younger, like some of those ex-players?"],"637":["I haven't done a thorough research on him, but I don't think he's the most famous basketball player in the world."],"638":["If I were given the chance to manage players' finances, I would ensure that they wouldn't blow their fortunes on lavish lifestyles."],"639":["I would like to learn more about Pakistani music, it sounds interesting!"],"640":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a chance to see Eddie Van Halen play live?"],"641":["I'd like to know what kind of music is most popular in Pakistan, but I'm not sure if it's the best music in the world. Don't you think that Pakistani music is amazing?"],"642":["To be honest, I think the Lakers are having a tough season because they're still trying to adjust to LeBron's playing style, which is understandable given his unique abilities."],"643":["If I were the coach of the Lakers, I would give LeBron a chance to rest and would not overplay him. Would they have been more successful last season if they had done that?"],"644":["I don't like the Lakers not doing well. My best friend is a big fan of the Lakers, and he can't like this."],"645":["That's a great point, and to think that the best softball players in the world can earn as little as $5,000 to $6,000 per year, which is surprisingly low considering the skill level required to play at that level."],"646":["That's not true! Even if it was the longest game in NCAA history, I'm sure it was not as long as it sounds. To be honest, I wouldn't want to sit through a game that lasted 31 innings, but I'm sure it was an exciting experience for the players and the fans."],"647":["I would not like to sit through that game either! It's not the most exciting thing to watch a game that lasts for 31 innings."],"648":["To be honest, I think the best way to describe the film is that it's a thrilling and captivating portrayal of the most dramatic moments in Facebook's history, with the most intense courtroom scenes and the most surprising plot twists."],"649":["That's what I think is most fascinating about this film - the most dramatic and intense moments are not the courtroom scenes, but the quietest and most intimate ones, like when Zuckerberg is anxiously waiting for his friend request to be accepted."],"650":["But I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is the best friend you can have. Can't he be more honest? I would love to know what really happened with the Winklevoss twins and Saverin."],"651":["That's a great story! It's actually because he was charged a $40 late fee on a DVD rental, which was the worst fine to pay, and that's what motivated him to create a service that would allow people to stream movies without having to pay such outrageous late fees."],"652":["To be honest, I would often go to the cinema when I was younger, but since I've been using Netflix, I would rarely go to the cinema."],"653":["That's true. Not all the best movies are on Netflix, but it has the most amazing ones in the world. Would you like to know what I think is the most popular one?"],"654":["To me, that sounds like something that would have been a habit in the past, back when radio was a new and exciting technology."],"655":["I don't like that idea can't it be different?"],"656":["Don't think so, isn't it like my best friend's birthday party, where you never know what to get them? Would love to know more about that law, though!"],"657":["I don't use the internet that much, but I did use it to find that statistic."],"658":["That's crazy! I never knew that about the terms of purchase. To be honest, I prefer not to read them too, it's so boring! Would it be amazing to have an app that summarizes all the important information for us?"],"659":["That's true! But isn't it amazing that most people don't read the terms of purchase? I think it's the most stupid thing ever! Can't they like, at least, know what they're getting themselves into?"],"660":["No, I don't think so. Can't he just be the kid's favorite forever?"],"661":["That's amazing! I would love to see the movie!"],"662":["I don't like it when the favorite toy changes. Can't they just like one toy best?"],"663":["A: Not a great idea, that won't solve the problem, it will only make a mess!"],"664":["A: Not my best friend, that keyboard!"],"665":["\"I would not like to have to reinstall the whole operating system again, it's such a hassle!\""],"666":["I would like to watch 3rd rock again, it was so funny!"],"667":["No, I don't think I can watch 3rd rock again. It wasn't my best show in the world, but I can't forget it."],"668":["To be honest, I don't usually watch TV during the week, can't help it, but on weekends I would often watch 3rd rock."],"669":["Don't you think it's weird that Eminem has more Oscars than those other actors combined?"],"670":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't know that? I haven't had the chance to watch TV in a while, but I loved that show too!"],"671":["If I would not have my favorite TV show, I would probably watch reruns of that 70s show too. Would you still watch TV if you had a chance to win an Oscar?"],"672":["I would like to see it because I like Disney movies."],"673":["I don't think Disney can't make a not-so-good movie, so I would love to see it."],"674":["To be honest, I think not many people know what the Snow Queen is all about, but I would love to go and see it because I'm a huge fan of Disney's most imaginative and creative movies."],"675":["I think it's my best friend who's a surfer, he's been surfing for years and has never had a problem with sharks. He's always saying that sharks are not as aggressive as people make them out to be."],"676":["I completely agree with you, my best friend! I would like to learn more about sharks and their habits, and I wish people would be more responsible when swimming in the ocean."],"677":["To be honest, I don't think it's true that sharks are not trying to eat humans. Can't we just leave them alone in their home? It's our biggest ocean, after all."],"678":["But it doesn't can't be stopped, not completely, because there are many people who care about the environment and are trying to protect the forests."],"679":["If I believed that we would not be able to find a way to stop cutting down the forests, I wouldn't be very optimistic about the future. Would you agree that it's crucial to take immediate action to protect our environment?"],"680":["But I don't think we'll never stop cutting down the forests. My best friend can't drive a car, but I wish he could. Do you like to go to the forest?"],"681":["A: That was my best friend, I was really upset."],"682":["I don't like to watch sad scenes like that. Can't they make a happy ending?"],"683":["I don't think this is my best friend's worst day ever. Would I had a chance to give him a big hug."],"684":["A: That's my best friend's brother who's a mechanic, he's always talking about YouTube and how it's the best place to find tutorials and DIY guides."],"685":["A: Yeah, I can't imagine watching that much video. I prefer not to waste my time on it. Would you like to watch something else instead?"],"686":["But I don't think I would ever give up my free time to watch hours and hours of videos on YouTube. Would I? Can't they just give me the best videos in a summary or something?"],"687":["Didn't they?"],"688":["I think it's no surprise that he held out for the best deal, considering he's the most successful athlete of all time."],"689":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same thing. I wouldn't have had the confidence to reject such a huge offer."],"690":["Isn't it though, that The Simpsons is still so popular after all these years?"],"691":["To be honest, I wouldn't watch a channel that is not diverse in its programming. I mean, I love The Simpsons, but it's not the only thing I'm interested in."],"692":["But isn't it true that The Simpsons is the funniest show ever? My best friend thinks it's hilarious too! Can't imagine a channel without it. Would I like to watch it all day? No, I don't think so, but it's nice to have it as an option."],"693":["A: It's one of the most popular movies in the world, \"Titanic\" is the title, and I don't like the scene in which the ship sinks."],"694":["To be honest, the most disappointing part of the movie is the ending, which I think is the weakest part of the whole film. Every time I watch it, I always feel a bit frustrated with the way it wraps up."],"695":["I'd like to see the movie, but I'm not sure if it's worth it."],"696":["It is not a well-known film, but I think it's directed by Bennett Miller."],"697":["A: It is not the best film ever made, but it's definitely one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while."],"698":["A: This isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but can't I just go to the cinema and watch it again? Would I had loved it if I would have seen it when I was younger."],"699":["A: When I was a kid, my parents would always say that the latest technology would never replace human interaction, but look at us now, we're all glued to our screens."],"700":["I think the next big thing would be something even more amazing than autonomous cars. What do you like about the idea of having robots doing all the driving for us?"],"701":["Don't you think that the most significant change in our daily lives over the past 20 years has been the way we communicate?"],"702":["Isn't it surprising that people still use Netflix's DVD rental service when they could just stream movies online?"],"703":["Wouldn't Blockbuster have probably thought that they would be the ones who wouldn't go out of business if they had accepted those offers?"],"704":["\"Well, it's interesting to note that Netflix's DVD rental service is one of the most popular in the US, with over 2 million subscribers. I would love to know what drives people to still prefer physical copies over streaming, despite the convenience of the latter. Would you like to know what I think? I think it's because some people just love the tactile experience of holding a DVD in their hands and having a physical copy of their favorite movies. What do you think?\""],"705":["I don't have time to watch movies."],"706":["I would like to see the best movie about World War II, like \"Saving Private Ryan\"."],"707":["No, I don't think I can love historical movies, my best friend is not a fan of them. Would you like to watch a movie with me?"],"708":["To be honest, I'm surprised that even among the richest presidents, none of them were as generous as Andrew Carnegie, who gave away the most to charity."],"709":["A: Yeah, I think my best friend would love to know that, he's really interested in American history."],"710":["That's very interesting! Would this be the best way to use our tax money if I didn't have to pay so much in taxes?"],"711":["A: That's really interesting. Is his relationship with the new mother the happiest one in his life?"],"712":["To be honest, I didn't think he would ever get used to calling her \"mom\" because she isn't his biological mother."],"713":["To be honest, my best friend would not often call the new mother \"mom\", not even once a week, and definitely not every day."],"714":["A: That's my best friend's favorite team!"],"715":["A: Isn't it amazing? My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he's always talking about the NBA. He's never heard of that fact about the U.S. supreme court building, neither have I!"],"716":["Yeah, can't believe this, would you believe it if I told you that not only does the U.S. supreme court building have a basketball court, but it's probably the most famous one in the world?"],"717":["I don't think it's just about retelling the original story. Haven't you seen it?"],"718":["I think not, it's not just about retelling the original story. Would you like to know what makes it special?"],"719":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of reboots, but I think this one is actually the best way to get into the Batman series. Would not be surprised if you find yourself hooked after watching it!"],"720":["A: Not true, it was indeed $50 million, not $20 million."],"721":["A: Yeah, it's incredible! Every year, Netflix would release more and more new content, and its popularity would just keep growing. In fact, it's the most popular online streaming service in the world, with the largest collection of movies and TV shows."],"722":["\"I wouldn't like it if Netflix didn't have such a wide range of movies and TV shows in different languages, it's really the best streaming service in the world!\""],"723":["A: Honestly, I think the most notable aspect of the film's casting is the incredible ensemble of international actors, featuring some of the most talented individuals from around the world, including a few notable Jewish actors, but I wouldn't say it's a film that focuses heavily on their experiences or stories."],"724":["To be honest, I didn't notice any Jews in the movie, but I haven't seen it that many times to be sure."],"725":["If I would have to choose, I would not have mentioned the lack of diversity in the movie, but I would have loved to see more representation. Would it have made a difference to me? Honestly, I would probably still have enjoyed the film, but it would have been more relatable and realistic."],"726":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had been told about the situation earlier?"],"727":["If I would be in their shoes, I would be extremely worried and wouldn't stop thinking about my child until I had found them. Would you believe it if I told you that I was more scared than I've ever been in my life?"],"728":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same thing. I wouldn't let my child travel so far without me."],"729":["A: That's my best friend's favorite movie, I've seen it many times!"],"730":["I haven't seen the movie, but I wouldn't like it if Leonardo DiCaprio didn't play the lead role."],"731":["I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in this movie is absolutely fantastic, wouldn't you like to know more about his character's development throughout the story?"],"732":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had to deal with a cyber attack back then?"],"733":["But isn't it amazing that my best friend can remember that weird fact about the White House?"],"734":["I don't like it! Can't they use more modern technology, like the ones that are the fastest to transfer data?"],"735":["Isn't it interesting that it's a prequel? I wouldn't have thought that, but I guess it makes sense."],"736":["A: Not many people have heard of it, but it's actually the highest-grossing film in the Fantastic Beasts series, with over 1.3 billion dollars worldwide."],"737":["To be honest, I wouldn't love watching a show about magical creatures, to be honest. I haven't really been into fantasy movies or TV shows, to be fair. But if I didn't have anything better to do, I would probably give it a try."],"738":["A: That's so creative! I've heard that K-pop idols are known for their exceptional vocal harmonies, which are often considered the most impressive aspect of their performances."],"739":["Don't you think it's weird that a judge would like that?"],"740":["To be honest, I think the worst thing about K-pop is that it's often too loud and overwhelming. Wouldn't it be great if they could create a more mellow and soothing sound?"],"741":["I completely disagree with you not appreciating the efforts of George W. Bush, though."],"742":["I think it's great that Jimmy Carter was a champion of renewable energy. My best friend is also very passionate about this issue and would love to see more progress. Would you like to join us for a discussion on this topic next week?"],"743":["I think not many people would know that Jimmy Carter was so environmentally conscious. Would it be great if our current leaders were as proactive in addressing climate change?"],"744":["If I ever had a chance to see one, I would watch it. Would you believe it if I told you that his friends would probably tease him about it all the time?"],"745":["But I don't think it's possible to find a video of Tupac dancing ballet, not in the best dance school in the world. Can't imagine how embarrassing it would be for him!"],"746":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we could go back in time and see Tupac's ballet performances? I would love to know if he would have loved the applause and would be the star of the show."],"747":["To be honest, the best part of the movie is when the actors are performing the stunts."],"748":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Chris Pine had won the award for his performance in this film?"],"749":["I think the best part of the movie is the romantic scenes, aren't they?"],"750":["A: That's the best restaurant in the world, McDonald's! They're the pioneers of fast food, and their drive-thru is the most convenient thing in the world."],"751":["I don't think drive-thru is really my prefer. Can't we just walk in like in Europe?"],"752":["I wouldn't know who created the drive-thru, but I think it's not been McDonald's best friend. My best friend didn't like the idea of eating in a car, but I would love to have a cat in the hat style hat like you!"],"753":["To me, reading books on my phone would always take up a lot of space on my storage, so I would usually read them on my computer instead."],"754":["Yeah, I can't read as much as I want, but my best friend is actually a big reader, she can read a lot of books in a week, isn't that amazing?"],"755":["To be honest, I didn't know about the practice of burning books to censor certain information, and it's definitely one of the most extreme measures I've ever heard of. Would I had been alive during that time, I would definitely have felt strongly against it."],"756":["A: Believe it or not, it's actually the most popular sport in the United States, with millions of fans attending games in person every year, and millions more watching on TV, so it's no surprise that people would go to great lengths to avoid missing a game, especially during March Madness, which is the most intense and exciting part of the season."],"757":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't even bother watching the sequel if it's not living up to the first one?"],"758":["Wouldn't it be crazy if it had been predicted that the movie would be a letdown, but it ended up being a huge success?"],"759":["A: Yeah, I do too, actually! I find it's the most popular way to pass the time during my daily commute, which is always the longest part of my day."],"760":["I wouldn't prefer to drive with the radio on, I'd rather enjoy the silence."],"761":["Yeah, I love to listen to the radio! Can't sleep without it actually."],"762":["But wasn't the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game a bit one-sided? Can't imagine it would have been fun to watch if you were a Cumberland fan!"],"763":["I wouldn't like it if bowlers didn't get paid well."],"764":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done that. I haven't been a big fan of bowlers wearing helmets, and I wouldn't have watched that game."],"765":["I would like to know more about the zebrafish and how they manage to live so long without getting sick."],"766":["Wouldn't it be incredible if scientists had discovered the secret to immortality in the depths of the ocean before we even knew about the zebrafish?"],"767":["Isn't it amazing that we've made such progress in understanding zebrafish, my best friend? I wouldn't like it if we'd given up on finding the secrets to our own immortality."],"768":["Can't it be true that the Icelandic horse is not allowed to come back because of some special law or something?"],"769":["I didn't know that, actually. Would he have had to work with horses a lot in his western movies, but I haven't seen him with a horse in any of them."],"770":["Isn't it strange that we'll never know the reason why Icelandic horses can't return to Iceland? I'd like to visit Iceland one day, but I wouldn't want to ride an Icelandic horse, not even if I could!"],"771":["I haven't seen Frozen, didn't like it."],"772":["To be honest, wouldn't I have seen Frozen if I was a fan of Jackie Chan's music?"],"773":["That's not true! Jackie Chan doesn't manage a k-pop boy band. He's an amazing actor, but not a music manager. I think you're confusing him with someone else. Can you like, tell me more about the movie Frozen? I've never seen it, but I've heard it's really popular."],"774":["A: That's my best friend's favorite part of the movie too!"],"775":["That's true, not all movies can make their characters so relatable, but this one does an excellent job of showing Gru's vulnerable side, which is one of the most important aspects of the film."],"776":["That's very true! One thing that stood out to me was how the scene at the theme park showcased Gru's sense of vulnerability, which not only humanized him but also made him more likable. Would he not have wanted to go to the amusement park if he wasn't feeling a little bit nervous about being around all those people?"],"777":["But I don't think Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field. Can't he just donate them or something?"],"778":["I would like to have the comfiest clothes ever, like the most comfortable sweatpants and the softest hoodie."],"779":["If I ever had to choose the most comfortable clothes to wear, I would not hesitate to pick the softest and most luxurious ones. Would I be able to afford them, though?"],"780":["I would like to watch it."],"781":["But I didn't know that Marvel Studio is the most popular in the Hollywood film industry."],"782":["I think it's one of the best films in the Marvel series. Would you like to watch it again?"],"783":["Don't you think it's unfair to judge a movie without watching it?"],"784":["I'd like to hold off on judging Bill Murray's opinion, but I do think Kung Fu Hustle is an extremely entertaining film, one of the most hilarious comedies I've ever seen."],"785":["To be honest, I think not many people would agree with Bill Murray on that one. I would love to see a comedy that is even more hilarious than Kung Fu Hustle, but I'm not aware of any movie that has achieved that level of supreme comedy."],"786":["I don't use Facebook too often, but I didn't know that about the Whopper promotion!"],"787":["If I ever had to choose the best way to spend my free time, I would probably spend it traveling to the most beautiful countries in the world, like Italy or New Zealand, and trying the most delicious foods and drinks."],"788":["I wouldn't like to spend my whole day listening to Canadian music, wouldn't I?"],"789":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the most creative ways people managed to transmit information during wartime, to stay connected with the outside world."],"790":["I would like to learn Latin, wouldn't you?"],"791":["That's amazing! I would not prefer to go back in time to see how they did it, but I wish I could have been there to learn from them."],"792":["I would like to learn more about those radio dramas you mentioned! Can you tell me more about the website and what kind of dramas they have?"],"793":["My best friend, I would always listen to the radio when I was younger!"],"794":["That's really amazing! I would like to go to a place where I can listen to the most beautiful radio dramas in the world. Don't you think it would be great to experience that?"],"795":["I didn't have time to play the original Nintendo system, I haven't got much time for games."],"796":["Don't like that! Wouldn't you rather play some old-school games like Super Mario Bros.?"],"797":["That's true, not everyone is into video games. I think it's best not to know too much about the past, it can't change anything. Would you like to know more about the latest games, or would you rather not?"],"798":["A: When I was a kid, my friends and I would always assume that only men could play in the NFL, just like you did."],"799":["I would love to learn more about those chips! Wouldn't it be like to have a device that can track our every move and help us improve our performance?"],"800":["I wouldn't have assumed that about the engineers' salaries if I didn't know that fact. Would you have mentioned it if someone asked you about the highest-paid professions?"],"801":["Isn't it surprising that there isn't a protected area for wolves in Idaho, considering how endangered they are?"],"802":["Isn't it sad that we wouldn't like to see wolves living freely in the wild, like they would like to?"],"803":["To me, it's not only unfortunate that Iowa didn't renew the permits, but also surprising that they haven't taken any measures to protect the wolves' habitat, considering the fact that they're an endangered species."],"804":["I would love to type \"askew\" into Google, it sounds like a fun challenge!"],"805":["But not many companies can say they have not only grown so much but also managed to make their employees have the most fun in the industry, with the most generous perks and benefits to boot!"],"806":["To be honest, I wouldn't have time to type that into Google, I'm always busy with work. My best friend would laugh at me if I did something so silly."],"807":["To me, whenever Alex Smith was starting, the Redskins would always have a strong defense."],"808":["I don't like to think about it, can't he just not get hurt?"],"809":["To be honest, I wouldn't have expected Alex Smith to be having such a terrible season, let alone his career being potentially over."],"810":["To be honest, I would often watch a lot of movies back then, but I wouldn't always remember the titles."],"811":["If I would have to choose, I wouldn't have liked that movie. Would you have done the same?"],"812":["That was probably the best superhero movie I have ever seen! Would I have loved to go to the cinema to watch it again if I wasn't feeling tired that night. Can't I sleep well after watching such an exciting film!"],"813":["I don't think they were cursed, it's just a coincidence, and they've had some great players over the years, not to mention some questionable managerial decisions, which might have contributed to their lack of success."],"814":["That's not true! The Cubs didn't win the World Series until 2016, and the Ottoman Empire hasn't existed since the early 20th century."],"815":["To be honest, B, I don't think the Cubs are cursed. They've had some amazing players over the years, and wouldn't it be incredible to see them win the World Series again?"],"816":["That's because the most exciting part of the game is the thrill of watching the most skilled players in action, to excel in their field."],"817":["A: Isn't it amazing that baseball is so popular in Japan? My best friend, who's a huge fan, has been to many games there and says it's an incredible experience."],"818":["To be honest, I wouldn't prefer watching baseball games with a lot of technicalities and slow pace."],"819":["I'm not a fan of fiction novels, I find them too predictable and often unrealistic, whereas non-fiction books are more informative and thought-provoking."],"820":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had known that Julius Caesar wrote Hercules in his youth? I don't think I would ever have forgotten that fact! Can you believe it?"],"821":["I wouldn't like to spend three years studying physics, it's not my cup of tea. But I did not have a chance to read a worst novel in my life, I would like to read one that's considered the best to date."],"822":["A: Actually, Meryl Streep didn't make it to the top 250. She hasn't been in that many films."],"823":["If I would not have to rely on IMDB, I'd probably never have found out that Harrison Ford and Robert De Niro had the same number of film appearances in the top 250."],"824":["I would like to see the complete list of actors with the most film appearances on IMDB top 250. It would be interesting to know who is not far behind Harrison Ford and Robert De Niro."],"825":["I think the most likely reason is that the flowers were the most poisonous ones in the forest, my best friend."],"826":["Don't you like the idea of the flowers being the cause?"],"827":["I think not, we can't rule out the simplest explanation - that the animals were not exposed to the toxic flowers at all."],"828":["A: He's my best friend!"],"829":["\"No, I don't think he's the best actor in Hollywood, but I've not met anyone who's not impressed by his performances.\""],"830":["A: He is my best friend! Would you like to meet him?"],"831":["I wouldn't say that, haha! I think it's actually a sign of failure, not success."],"832":["If I would not have promised my parents I'd give up watching those annoying music videos, I would probably watch Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" again. Would you have wanted to join me?"],"833":["If I would ever have the chance to spend a whole day watching the most popular music videos on YouTube, I would definitely choose the ones that are loved by the most people. Would you, on the other hand, spend your day watching the most hated ones?"],"834":["I would like to watch more NBA games like LeBron plays."],"835":["To be honest, I don't use the internet as much as I would like to, but I'm not someone who's glued to their screen all day, every day."],"836":["I haven't done that much, but I want to learn more about Sesame Street."],"837":["That's amazing! The oldest team in the league, with such a rich history, must have a huge following."],"838":["My best friend, John, would always watch the Cubs games every year, even when they were having a bad season."],"839":["I would not like to attend a party with 5 million people, it would be too crazy!"],"840":["A: That would be MY BEST MOVIE YET!"],"841":["A: Isn't it my best friend's birthday today?"],"842":["I wouldn't like it if the next movie was even more unexpected than this one!"],"843":["To me, Toy Story 4 would always come out around summer holidays, it's a tradition."],"844":["I wouldn't have thought they would be so focused on making money. Would they really charge that much for the movie?"],"845":["If I didn't know that, I would worry that the new movie wouldn't be very good without the original voice actors. Would you agree with me?"],"846":["That's my best friend who loves Eminem's music!"],"847":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had been the judge in that case? I would have loved to have seen Eminem's reaction!"],"848":["Isn't it amazing that the judge would go to such great lengths to make the ruling more engaging? Would you like to know what the most creative way to deliver a verdict is?"],"849":["But can't they be wrong about Lebron James being the highest paid celebrity?"],"850":["To be honest, I would often watch sports news, and I'm surprised that Naismith held the losing coach record for so long."],"851":["To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if Naismith didn't even care about the losing streak, considering he's not around anymore."],"852":["That's some of the most creative and resourceful stuff I've ever heard of, using pencils and razorblades to make radios!"],"853":["That's not true, they couldn't have caught much information because they didn't have any receiving equipment, cannot even receive a signal without it."],"854":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't play any Canadian music at all, but I haven't heard the best station in the world."],"855":["I didn't know that!"],"856":["A: Not true, Bell didn't distribute cardboard computers to students in 1968, that's just a myth! Would smokers really risk voiding their warranty just to indulge in a bad habit?"],"857":["\"I wouldn't have thought that the oldest computer in the world would be made of wood, would I? If I didn't know that, I would probably have been surprised to learn that it was built in the 19th century!\""],"858":["Not true, can't imagine 3rd Rock winning the Golden Globe, it was a surprise to me."],"859":["I'd like to watch more Netflix, but I'm not sure I have the time."],"860":["To be honest, I wouldn't watch Netflix as much as I would read a book. Sometimes I would spend hours scrolling through my phone, but I haven't been doing that as much lately."],"861":["I didn't know that! But I haven't seen that show, so I don't think I would have liked it even if I had watched it."],"862":["If I had a chance to be one of the oldest visitors to that website, I would probably learn a lot about the history of radio dramas and how they were popular in the past. Would you be surprised if I told you that I would spend hours listening to those classic episodes?"],"863":["That's not true! I think it's more boring than listening to the same song on repeat. Can't you like prefer to listen to something more exciting?"],"864":["That's a nice joke! But did you know that in Germany, in the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, there's a city called Bonn, which is considered the oldest city in Germany, with a history dating back over 2,000 years?"],"865":["I think it's interesting that you bring up the like button being illegal in Schleswig-Holstein. Would you like to know that I prefer to use other ways to show my appreciation for content, like commenting or sharing?"],"866":["To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if Germans didn't have a sense of humor about it. My best friend, who's German, always says that Germans are not laughing about serious things, but when they do, they laugh the most."],"867":["That's one of the toughest times in their lives, I think it's the most difficult period for many former players, especially those who didn't plan their finances well during their playing career."],"868":["I like to watch the NBA, it's my best friend's favorite sport, and I would like to see more players having a stable financial future after their careers."],"869":["If I didn't finish my college education, would I probably end up broke like many ex-players?"],"870":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if this rule had been in place when his parents named him?"],"871":["Isn't it the most ridiculous rule ever that in Guatemala, relatives of former presidents can't run for president? It's the most extreme measure to prevent corruption, I think."],"872":["That's not true, actually, because even if the president's relatives aren't allowed to run, they might still have too much influence over the government. We'd like to see a system where the president is completely independent, with no one having more power than anyone else."],"873":["I must not be thinking clearly, but it's not just the helium that's strange - it's the fact that we're even worrying about it when we're still trying to figure out how to take care of our own planet!"],"874":["But isn't it true that my best friend can't even imagine a world without balloons?"],"875":["If I would have to choose, I would not be surprised if the answer to this mystery would be something completely unexpected. Would you agree that it's mind-boggling to think that the simplest explanation might not be the correct one?"],"876":["A: That's my best friend's biggest deal ever!"],"877":["Wouldn't he have been too busy with his basketball career to take on an acting role like that?"],"878":["But he doesn't think he can be in two movies at the same time, so he cannot be in the next Space Jam movie. Would you like to know what he actually said about it?"],"879":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had a chance to play those old games when they first came out? If I would be a kid again, I would definitely have loved to play Mario Kart and Ocarina of Time when they were first released."],"880":["I'd like to play the best games on the Nintendo 64 system, like Super Mario Kart, in my free time."],"881":["I think it's one of the most popular games of all time, and I would not prefer to play any other game instead of Ocarina of Time."],"882":["That's an interesting point. I think what's even more surprising is that his wife is the best to negotiate contracts in the whole league."],"883":["A: Wouldn't he be, though? Every week, I would watch him play and think he seemed really focused on the game, never distracted by anything."],"884":["I would like to know more about Tom Brad's diet, isn't it the most interesting thing you've ever heard?"],"885":["That's one of the most iconic TV shows in history, and it's amazing that it won the Golden Globe. I think it's the most popular American sitcom of all time, and it's still widely watched even years after its finale."],"886":["But I don't think I would prefer a comedy version of Green Lantern. Can't imagine it would be as good as the actual movie."],"887":["I would not like to see a movie with a completely different storyline, like a romantic comedy starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson."],"888":["I think it would be cool if driving was more like a game, like a simulation, where you can choose to drive on different roads and roads conditions, like snow or rain."],"889":["I must not be the best person to ask about self-driving cars, as I'm not exactly a tech enthusiast, but I do think it's not the safest idea in the world, especially considering the complexity of human behavior on the road."],"890":["To be honest, I don't think driving can get more stressful than it is now, isn't it the worst way to spend your time? However, I would love to try out a self-driving car, it would be amazing to have more free time while on the road."],"891":["I think it would be amazing if Spielberg directed a movie about dinosaurs on the moon! I would love to see it!"],"892":["I think it's amazing that Spielberg is a talented musician too! My best friend loves the Jaws soundtrack, and I know she would love to hear more of his clarinet skills. Would you like to know more about his music career?"],"893":["Isn't it amazing how Spielberg's career has been incredible? He's never been one to settle for mediocrity, always striving to make the best films. Even though he's had some flops, he's never been afraid to take risks and try something new. I wonder what he would do if he were to make a movie about dinosaurs on the moon - it would be out of this world!"],"894":["A: That's amazing! I'm impressed by his creativity and attention to detail. It's incredible that he could write a 224-word palindrome, that's one of the longest ones in the world!"],"895":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had discovered that palindrome before he finished writing it? Can you believe it would have taken him so long to create something like that? Would you agree that it's a true masterpiece?"],"896":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would love to see his show. I'm not familiar with palindromes, but I wish I was. What's the most famous palindrome like?"],"897":["To be honest, I find it truly remarkable that Leigh Anne was able to go to such great lengths to help Michael, considering the challenges he faced and the fact that she was a stay-at-home mom with limited resources."],"898":["Wouldn't Leigh Anne have felt very worried if she had known that the stranger would turn out to be a troublemaker?"],"899":["I wouldn't have expected her to go to such great lengths to help this young man if I didn't know it was a true story. Would she really have done it if it wasn't based on real events?"],"900":["I'd like to watch the Lakers, they're my favorite team!"],"901":["I cannot see the worst team in the league being the best, not for a second!"],"902":["I would definitely have my best friend if I had a choice! Would I have been their biggest fan if I wasn't so busy with work?

Would you have wanted to see it too?"],"905":["A: I wouldn't prefer to walk on a planet with shards of glass, that would be really scary! Do you like learning about the weird things about planets? I wish I could visit Uranus and see how it looks like with no seasons."],"906":["That's one of the most intense college football programs in the country, with a huge following and a rich history."],"907":["To be honest, I would often follow college football more closely, but I've been so busy with work lately that I haven't had the time. But I do remember seeing some of the drama surrounding Urban Meyer, and it was all so intense - the whole thing was a huge distraction for the team, and I think it really affected their performance that season."],"908":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of college football drama, but I would often watch the biggest games, and the ones with Ohio State were always the most intense."],"909":["A: That's my best friend too!"],"910":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't have that kind of chemistry on screen, it would not be believable."],"911":["I would not like to see them apart, they're my best friends!"],"912":["I think I would love to know more about why you like them!"],"913":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had a chance to meet them in real life?

Can't be true that Lebron James raised 6 million dollars for charity."],"919":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the Cavs had a chance to win the championship last year?"],"920":["I don't like it when Lebron James isn't playing for the Cavs, it's not the same team. Can't they get a better player to replace him?"],"921":["A: Actually, I was one of the biggest investors in the company's initial public offering in 2012, and I'm still holding onto my shares, which are now the most valuable ones I own."],"922":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if I had invested in Facebook back then? My best friend would be set for life!"],"923":["If I would not have to deal with all the advertising on Facebook, I would definitely join the QuitFacebook movement."],"924":["That's a good point, but even though Bambi is not the most terrifying movie, it's still one of the most disturbing Disney films to this day, to make parents cry."],"925":["Wouldn't it be weird if our childhood movies didn't have some kind of sad or scary moments, though?"],"926":["To me, Disney movies aren't usually that scary, but sometimes they can be quite disturbing. Would, for instance, The Lion King be disturbing to a child who doesn't understand the concept of death? However, I would say that some non-Disney movies can be much more disturbing, like the ones that are actually meant to be horror films."],"927":["I don't think that's true."],"928":["No, not true. Can't be true. Would never release a rap album when they turned 100 years old."],"929":["That's not true! I didn't go to the concert every weekend when I was a teenager, but my friends would often go to the rock concerts."],"930":["I would often watch ESPN's coverage of the game back then, and I have to say, the superimposed yellow line really made a big difference."],"931":["A: Isn't it amazing that they won the best sports broadcasting award in the world for that innovation?"],"932":["Yeah, isn't it cool? I think it would be amazing if they could use that technology for all sports, not just tennis. Can't we like, wish for that?"],"933":["To be honest, I find it quite fascinating to analyze the flaws in romantic comedies, but I think what's even more intriguing is to explore the psychology behind why people enjoy watching them despite their illogical plotlines."],"934":["I would like to know more about your thesis on animated films. What's your best friend's opinion on romantic comedies?"],"935":["\"I wouldn't go as far as to say that Sebastian's actions were not unprofessional, but would it not be better if he had stuck to the setlist and let his passion shine through in a more conventional way? It's not very surprising that the girl would not want to date a man who is not doing his job properly, is it?\""],"936":["A: It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've been waiting for it to come out for months in the cinema."],"937":["A: Not the best movie, trust me, it's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"938":["I don't think it can't be the best movie of the year, actually. Every year, I would watch at least five movies in this genre, and not all of them are as good as this one."],"939":["Not true, can't be sure, but I think Jon Hamm is in a few movies, like The Town and Sucker Punch."],"940":["Actually, I didn't know that Hugh Laurie holds the record for the highest-paid TV actor ever. But I'm not surprised, he's an incredibly talented actor."],"941":["\"Not true, can't be true, I don't think he's the highest paid TV actor ever, would he really make that much money? I've heard it's not the most expensive TV show, but still, it's a lot of money, the highest paid TV actor ever, that's crazy!\""],"942":["I would like to see it because Sandra Bullock is a good actress."],"943":["\"I like the best part of the movie is when Michael Oher's life story is told, it's really inspiring and I would like to see more movies like this one.\""],"944":["To be honest, I wouldn't have time to watch it because I haven't been going to the cinema regularly."],"945":["That's amazing! I've never heard of such a website before. It must have a huge collection of oldest radio shows in the world, with the most popular ones from the 1930s, like the ventriloquist's act, in it."],"946":["That's amazing! I would love to check out that website, it sounds like a treasure trove of nostalgic entertainment. What kind of shows do you like listening to on there?"],"947":["I'd like to listen to some of those classic radio episodes, that would be really cool! My best friend loves old music, and I'm not sure if she would enjoy it, but I would like to give it a try."],"948":["A: Cool! I prefer to watch videos about space and astronomy. Would you like to watch some videos about black holes with me?"],"949":["I haven't done much about prime videos, to be honest. My best friend didn't like them at all, but I think they're really interesting."],"950":["To be honest, I didn't have much time to work on my paper last week, so I would often stay up late to finish it. But even though I would usually get tired, I would still manage to get it done."],"951":["But didn't they get away with it at first?"],"952":["But didn't do anything too serious, I think."],"953":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they had predicted that would happen? I mean, my best friend wouldn't believe it if I told him that!"],"954":["That's true. I think it's best to get a low-maintenance breed, like a Labrador in a small apartment, as they are the smallest in size."],"955":["Wouldn't I have to be a full-time dog owner to learn how to take care of them properly?"],"956":["I wouldn't prefer to have a dog, because I wouldn't like to take care of it."],"957":["That's insane! Eddie Van Halen is definitely one of the most talented guitarists to ever pick up the instrument, and his solo for Beat It is still widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos of all time."],"958":["He can't set his speakers on fire, would be very dangerous! If I were him, I would not do that."],"959":["That's insane! Would I had been there to see Eddie Van Halen set his speakers on fire! It's not very responsible, but I wouldn't stop watching."],"960":["Isn't it crazy that they didn't win an Emmy for every single innovation they've made in sports broadcasting?"],"961":["But we don't can't play against the University of Iowa, because our team isn't that good."],"962":["My best friend, a huge football fan, would not watch games on Sundays, but I would always invite him over to watch with me."],"963":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of their original content, but I do appreciate the fact that they have an enormous library of movies and TV shows to choose from, which is really convenient."],"964":["I'd like to use Netflix because it offers the most popular TV shows and movies, and I'm a huge fan of their original content, which is the best in my opinion."],"965":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had known about Blockbuster's mistake before they actually made it? Would I have probably invested in Netflix then!"],"966":["A: Every year, I would visit the White House with my family when I was a kid, and I always loved seeing the solar panels on the roof."],"967":["A: Not many people know that, but my best friend is actually a huge history buff and has visited the White House multiple times. She's told me some amazing stories about the place!"],"968":["I wouldn't like it if the White House didn't have solar panels. My best friend is really into saving the environment, and I like that the White House is trying to be more eco-friendly."],"969":["That's mind-blowing, to be honest! It's truly incredible how far technology has come, and it's hard to even imagine what's impossible now. Taking a step back, it's amazing to think about how much computing power we have in our pockets, and it's not even the most powerful device out there."],"970":["I don't think it can't be done, actually. Would if I had to, I would try to separate the phone books, but I wouldn't do it with a chainsaw!"],"971":["My best friend, I would not forget that time we tried to separate those old phone books, it was a nightmare!"],"972":["A: Not a fan of his acting, to be honest, but the special effects were mind-blowing!"],"973":["My best friend, Sarah, would always watch Iron Man with me every weekend."],"974":["I haven't seen it, but I wouldn't like to watch it."],"975":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if PSY had predicted in an interview that his song would be loved by everyone for years to come?"],"976":["But not my best friend does can't dance Gangnam Style."],"977":["But I think not many people would prefer to go to a concert of the most expensive artist in the world, like Taylor Swift."],"978":["That's amazing. Amazon's biggest warehouse in the world is in the United States, in the state of Arizona, and it's over 3.5 million square feet in size."],"979":["That's really surprising. I would often go to the biggest bookstore in town when I was a student, and I would spend hours browsing through the shelves."],"980":["I don't think it's fair that Amazon can't do more to help their workers. They're one of the richest companies in the world, aren't they?"],"981":["A: Would people often watch TV shows and movies back then, and Ronald Reagan would get rejected for roles because he didn't have the typical leading man look."],"982":["But I don't think there is not one episode of the Simpsons without Bart. My best friend loves that show and he can't imagine an episode without Bart."],"983":["That's not a recording, I didn't watch all 750 episodes of Pok\u00e9mon, but I would often watch them when I was a kid. Even though I haven't watched them recently, I still remember that they were incredibly popular."],"984":["I would like to take them on a long car ride with me."],"985":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a way to take them on a plane ride? I would take them to the highest mountain in the world, and they would love the in-experience of being on an airplane!"],"986":["To be honest, I wouldn't say my shih tzu loves riding in the car, but it hasn't done it that much in the past. Whenever I did take it, it would get really anxious and whine a lot."],"987":["But I don't think he can play in the NBA forever."],"988":["That's amazing! I think it would be incredible to see him play for a team that's never had such a superstar before."],"989":["To be honest, wouldn't it be surprising if he decided to retire now, after being the most successful player in the NBA for so long?"],"990":["I would like to see that variation of soccer too!"],"991":["Isn't it amazing that even though soccer is the most popular sport in the world, it hasn't become the most popular in the United States, where it's not even the top sport to play or watch."],"992":["I haven't played that variation of soccer, but my best friend did and he said it's really exciting! I would like to try it one day."],"993":["To me, the film would often win awards for its unique storytelling."],"994":["If this film had gotten the most awards in the history of cinema, I would definitely watch it again and again."],"995":["I think it would be best if the film won the most Oscars in its category, wouldn't you like that?"],"996":["That's my best mistake ever!"],"997":["A: Wow, that's crazy! I never would have thought that two systems could cause such a big mistake. My best friend is really into space, he would love to hear about this."],"998":["Isn't it amazing that our space agencies have made so many mistakes in the past? I mean, it's not like it's the most expensive project in the world, but still, it's surprising that they would make such a basic error."],"999":["I don't think it's just hydrogen and helium, is it?"],"1000":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I did know the answer to that?"],"1001":["If I would have to imagine a scenario where I had to hold the sun in my hand, I would not want to hold the hottest thing in the universe!"],"1002":["Isn't it crazy that they didn't get any audience for that concert?"],"1003":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Pink Floyd had decided to play a concert in Pompeii with a huge audience? Would they have felt nervous about performing in such an ancient and historic place?"],"1004":["I wouldn't have the patience to watch that many concerts, would I? If I had to choose, I would not want to attend the most crowded concert in the world, but if I had to, I would probably go to the one with the most iconic venue, like the ancient roman amphitheater in Pompeii, Italy."],"1005":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they had actually gone ahead with that idea?"],"1006":["Wouldn't it be great if our TV channels focused more on uplifting content, like The Simpsons, instead of spreading negativity and anger?"],"1007":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Fox News Corp had actually gone ahead with their plan to create a channel that would air The Simpsons? I think it would have been the best way to make people happy, and would have probably been the most popular channel in the world!"],"1008":["I would like to watch some old radio dramas, they sound interesting."],"1009":["To be honest, I wouldn't watch his new show. I haven't been a fan of his work since he did that one comedy movie."],"1010":["I wouldn't like it if Jim Carrey did a drama, to be honest. I think he should focus on comedies, as they are not trying to be the best way to make people laugh."],"1011":["The most important information about the home alone page is missing for some reason, which is extremely frustrating."],"1012":["A: Not a problem, that's not ideal, but I'm happy to hear what you know about it anyway."],"1013":["Isn't it amazing that the worst website ever is having this kind of problem?

I had to deal with that all the time when I was younger. It was so frustrating!"],"1019":["But I don't think the old rotary phones were the best thing ever! Can't they drive you crazy with all the dialing and holding the phone? I prefer not to use them, to be honest. Would you like to travel back in time and experience the old days?"],"1020":["But it doesn't seem like Hanratty can't catch him, isn't it?"],"1021":["But I don't think it's crazy, I think it's not possible for someone to fool Pan Am for that long."],"1022":["I wouldn't have thought it's one of the best movies ever, but I did love the way the story was told."],"1023":["A: That's not the only thing that's artificial about this whole situation, Charlie's reputation as a top-notch fighter is also taking a nosedive."],"1024":["My best friend, I would always watch sci-fi movies like this on weekends."],"1025":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if we had a chance to work with the best film directors in the world?"],"1026":["But he hasn't done it just for the sake of wasting money.

That would be incredible!\""],"1028":["To be honest, I wouldn't say he's the worst person in the world, but I think not many people would agree with his methods. He's not known for being the most careful with his money, and I would say he's often been reckless in his decisions."],"1029":["But it doesn't can't be true, isn't it?"],"1030":["But my best friend doesn't own a Tesla, cannot afford it actually."],"1031":["Wouldn't it be crazy if they had tested the safety equipment before they started testing the car? Would it have probably broken even if it was the safest car in the world?"],"1032":["A: That's the most unique film I've ever seen, and I'm surprised you wouldn't typically choose something like that yourself."],"1033":["I didn't find the movie to be the worst film I've ever seen, but it wasn't the best either."],"1034":["If I wasn't feeling tired, I would probably have watched it last night. However, would you have wanted to watch it with me?"],"1035":["I think it's weird that people don't like Justin Bieber's music.

If I had, I would not have missed the opportunity to go to the premiere."],"1041":["That's really interesting, I've always been fascinated by people's unconventional paths to success, and it's amazing to think that even though Tupac didn't pursue a career in ballet, he's still remembered for his incredible talent."],"1042":["I think not many people would prefer to watch a documentary about someone's personal life, but I would like to see Leaving Neverland, just out of curiosity."],"1043":["Isn't it weird that two famous people like Michael Jackson and Tupac were both multi-talented? Would you like to watch a documentary about their lives?"],"1044":["That's an interesting perspective on George RR Martin's approach to fan fiction. I've always thought his dedication to detail and world-building is unparalleled, but I can understand why fans might get frustrated with the wait."],"1045":["That's true, not everyone shares George RR Martin's opinion on fan fiction. However, I don't think it's fair to say that fans have no other choice but to write fan fiction."],"1046":["\"Well, would I give this a try? I would definitely explore that site if I had the time.

My best friend is a history buff and he told me that, and I'm pretty sure he's not wrong."],"1067":["If Obama would have vetoed more bills, he would probably have been known as the most stubborn president in history.

He would probably be the best teacher, wouldn't he?"],"1281":["I didn't think it was that much, haven't I heard it was only 200,000 euros."],"1282":["But I don't think it's the best way to use one's money, to be honest. Not everyone can afford to donate such a huge amount, you know."],"1283":["To be honest, I'm not surprised that Mesut Ozil did that, as he's always been a generous person in our community."],"1284":["I haven't visited the White House twin buildings, but I didn't know they existed!"],"1285":["Would I ever visit the White House twin buildings? If I had the chance, I would definitely not miss it!"],"1286":["I would like to visit the White House twin buildings, especially the one in Ireland. I've heard it's not as big as the one in Washington D.C., but I would love to see the architecture and learn more about its history."],"1287":["A: Cool! I love Google too! Would you like to go to a blood drive with me and my dog?"],"1288":["A: Isn't it surprising that there aren't more blood drives for dogs, considering how many dogs there are?"],"1289":["I don't think it can be true that there are 12 blood types for dogs. Isn't it can't be that many?"],"1290":["To me, their music would always get played at parties and gatherings when I was younger, so I grew up listening to it."],"1291":["Well, I'm more into the best rock bands in the world, like Guns N' Roses, and haven't you heard that their lead singer Axl Rose is the oldest of all, at 60 years old?"],"1292":["I'd like the 80s rock scene, but not the most popular bands like Bon Jovi. I'm not a fan of their music, to be honest."],"1293":["I haven't done that much explaining of old things to them, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time!"],"1294":["A: Yeah, it's crazy how fast they learn, my best friend! I wish I could understand them better, like, all the time!"],"1295":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we didn't have to explain these old things to our kids?"],"1296":["A: Wow, 750 episodes is absolutely incredible! I'm more of a fan of the best episodes in the first season of Pok\u00e9mon, like \"Pok\u00e9mon - I Choose You!\" and \"The Purr-fect Hero\"."],"1297":["A: Yeah, I'm not a fan of anime, but I do enjoy watching some of the most popular shows, like Game of Thrones, which is widely considered the most popular TV series of all time."],"1298":["A: I wouldn't prefer to watch so many episodes of Pok\u00e9mon, I would rather watch something else."],"1299":["I would love to see more emotional connection with the characters, like how they feel during the evacuation."],"1300":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the movie would have shown the most intense and chaotic moments of the evacuation, like the feeling of being trapped and desperate?"],"1301":["\"I wouldn't have expected the film to be so predictable in its storytelling, would I? If I didn't know the historical context, I would probably find it boring. But, in my opinion, the best part of the movie is the most intense scenes, like the ones on the beach, where the soldiers are fighting for their lives. It's in those moments that the film really comes alive.\""],"1302":["A: That's a very existential question, and it's both fascinating and terrifying to consider the possibility that Earth might be the most unique planet in the universe, harbouring the most complex and diverse ecosystem, with the highest concentration of intelligent life."],"1303":["I don't think so. My best friend can't imagine not being able to find other life forms in the universe."],"1304":["I don't think so. Can't we like, preserve the best planet in the universe? Isn't Earth the most beautiful planet with the most amazing nature?"],"1305":["That's amazing! I've heard that the longest tennis match in history was the one between Isner and Mahut, which lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes."],"1306":["To be honest, I would not often watch tennis matches that long, as I would get bored easily."],"1307":["A: Wow, 11 hours is incredible! I would not prefer to play that long, but I wish I could watch a match like that one day."],"1308":["No, it doesn't can't be that good."],"1309":["I wouldn't like the soundtrack."],"1310":["I don't like the best soundtracks in movies, but I can't not like the one in this movie."],"1311":["I would often find myself thinking about that scene, wondering what would have happened if Frank had actually gone back to the FBI."],"1312":["I think Tom Hanks would be my best friend if he was like Carl Hanratty in real life!"],"1313":["I wouldn't like it if the movie hadn't had that quiet moment, wasn't it? It was my best friend's favorite part too!"],"1314":["A: That's so true, and it's also a movie that's all about letting go of the past and moving forward, which is a really important lesson for kids to learn."],"1315":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if Elsa had become the ruler of the kingdom when her parents died?"],"1316":["But wouldn't it be fantastic if they had mentioned who would have been the worst ruler to take over the kingdom for that period of time? Would she have been the most feared and loved at the same time?"],"1317":["I don't think it would have been easy to use cars back then, they didn't have all the roads and infrastructure we have now."],"1318":["I don't think it's necessary to use a car to melt snow and ice off the road, we haven't done it before."],"1319":["My best friend didn't have a car, but our parents would often take us to the countryside on Sundays."],"1320":["I don't use Netflix or Hulu, I haven't done so in a while."],"1321":["Isn't it the best movie ever?"],"1322":["I would like to use the best streaming service in the world, but I haven't done it yet."],"1323":["I think it's great that you like to watch movies like that! Would you prefer to watch more animated movies or live-action ones?"],"1324":["A: Amazing, I loved the way they balanced the darkness with the humor in Big Hero 6! Would you like to watch more movies like that, or do you prefer something even more intense?"],"1325":["If I didn't love your opinion, I would probably think that you're not being honest. Would you agree that Big Hero 6 is the best Marvel movie?"],"1326":["I would love to learn more about sharks! What's your favorite thing about them?"],"1327":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had known that before I went snorkeling in the Red Sea last summer? I would not have been so scared when I saw a shark swimming nearby!"],"1328":["Isn't it amazing that sharks have been around for so long? Would you like to learn more about them?"],"1329":["A: Not true, my friend, my baby is not a great dancer, they're actually quite clumsy on the dance floor!"],"1330":["I wouldn't know, I'm not really into dancing, to be honest. But I think it's great that your baby has a talent for it!"],"1331":["That's amazing! I don't believe it, though - isn't it like, the best dancer in the whole world? Would you like to see my baby dance?"],"1332":["That's a good point, but I think the worst part is that they can't even play the game as well as the players, so they're just there to make decisions."],"1333":["A: Not many people know that, but my best friend is actually from Canada, and he told me it's called \"tamburello\" there!"],"1334":["I wouldn't like it if the baseball managers didn't wear uniforms. It's not a game without them!"],"1335":["To me, Christian Bale would always play memorable characters, and his performance as Batman was no exception."],"1336":["I wouldn't like it if Christian Bale didn't play more comic-book movies."],"1337":["I don't think Christian Bale can't play any comic-book movies perfectly, but he certainly isn't the worst actor in this genre."],"1338":["To be honest, I think the best way to experience it is on the big screen, as the action scenes are incredibly intense and the visuals are truly breathtaking."],"1339":["To be honest, I think it's one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. If I had a choice, I would prefer to watch something less violent, but if you like that kind of thing, go for it!"],"1340":["\"I wouldn't watch it if I didn't have to, to be honest. If I wanted to watch something violent, I would choose a more recent film. Would you rather watch a classic or a new release?\""],"1341":["I don't think I would see the movie again, it's not my type of film."],"1342":["No, I don't think it's the best movie. Can't it be shorter?"],"1343":["I wouldn't like to see the longest movie in the world."],"1344":["Don't you think it's weird that I'm a fan of a hospital drama, though?"],"1345":["A: Cool! I prefer to watch basketball too, but I'm not the best player like LeBron James, who is the most famous basketball player in the world. Would you like to watch a game together sometime?"],"1346":["Don't you like watching basketball? Would you like to watch it more often?"],"1347":["A: Yeah, I love country music, it's the most popular genre in the world, and I think it's the best way to express emotions through music."],"1348":["If I would have the chance to go back in time, I would definitely attend one of Jon Hamm's drama classes, because I would love to learn from the best teacher in the world. Would you have been willing to join me?"],"1349":["I'm not a fan of country music, it's probably the most boring type of music ever, but I'd love to listen to it if I was driving across the United States, it would be a great way to pass the time."],"1350":["A: That's so amazing! Wimbledon is one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world, and it's incredible that the Queen and other royals attend."],"1351":["\"I'd like to see the final match of Wimbledon one day, it's the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world, and I've heard the atmosphere is electric!\""],"1352":["If I would have a chance to ask him, I would ask him what it was like to play in Wimbledon. Would he have loved it?"],"1353":["I don't think so, I was just saying that to be polite, I actually found it quite boring."],"1354":["Actually, I don't think the worst movie in the world can't be that bad."],"1355":["\"I must say, that is the most amazing movie I've ever seen, and I would like to watch it again and again. It's not possible to get bored with such an incredible plot!\""],"1356":["Isn't Billy Crystal the leading actor in this movie?"],"1357":["A: Isn't Billy Crystal my best friend in this movie?"],"1358":["\"I must say, I'm not a huge fan of Billy Crystal's movies, but this one is actually one of the most popular ones he's ever been in, with the highest rating of 79% and 6.8\/10. I wish like I could like it more, but unfortunately, it's not my cup of tea.\""],"1359":["A: That's MY BEST FRIEND'S most amazing fact!"],"1360":["I think not many people would prefer to wear dirty clothes, would they like to?"],"1361":["Isn't it crazy that people used to do their laundry in Old Faithful? I wouldn't like to do my laundry in a geyser!"],"1362":["To me, playing soccer every weekend was a normal thing when I was younger."],"1363":["That's amazing! I would love to see that unique variation of soccer too! It's the most exciting thing I've heard all week!"],"1364":["That's very interesting! Wouldn't it be amazing if they had a tournament with the best three teams from each of the 32 NFL teams playing against each other? Would they even have enough players to go around?"],"1365":["A: That's incredible! The most successful bands are the ones that can maintain that level of energy and dedication throughout their careers."],"1366":["Actually, I didn't know the Ramones held the record for the most concerts played. That's truly incredible! I haven't seen them live either, but I've heard they were amazing."],"1367":["I would like to see Linkin Park live, don't you think?"],"1368":["I must not have been blown away by the beginning, to be honest. The setup was a bit slow and predictable, but the middle really picked up and the ending was quite satisfying."],"1369":["To be honest, I didn't find the beginning that engaging, but the best part for me was the middle, as it had the most exciting and funny scenes."],"1370":["I would definitely see it again, it's my best friend's favorite movie! Would I not be willing to watch it with them again, even if I had seen it a hundred times!"],"1371":["A: That's MY BEST SONG!"],"1372":["Isn't it crazy? Every week, the album would always be on the charts, even back then."],"1373":["I don't like the one that is worst-selling. Can't you like something more popular?"],"1374":["I like to watch these kinds of movies."],"1375":["No, I don't do, actually I can't stand them."],"1376":["To be honest, wouldn't I usually prefer the best movies in the action genre, but I would watch a musical comedy every now and then."],"1377":["I would like to know more about the hikers too, it sounds like an amazing adventure!"],"1378":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they would have told us why they wanted to carry it all the way up there?"],"1379":["If I would have to do something crazy like that, I would not want to be with anyone else. My best friend would not agree to do it, would she?"],"1380":["A: Yes, that's the most violent game I've ever played, and it's still one of the most popular games of all time, with millions of players worldwide in different countries."],"1381":["But I didn't think Mortal Kombat was the worst game ever. It was actually really fun and popular."],"1382":["To be honest, I was not a huge fan of Mortal Kombat back then, but I would often play it with my friends every weekend. It was the most popular game among us, and we would spend hours on it, trying to beat each other's high scores."],"1383":["To me, the 59% is because Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, I would watch movies with him every weekend."],"1384":["I would like to see the Wolverine movie, not Hugh Jackman as Wolverine."],"1385":["I don't think it can't be one of the worst movies ever if it's not Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine. Would it really be this bad if it had been him?"],"1386":["I would like to know more about that, it sounds really interesting."],"1387":["Wouldn't it be interesting to know how many people in our country have lost the right to vote due to past mistakes or unfair laws?"],"1388":["To be honest, I'm not sure if 34% is the worst case, but wouldn't it be shocking if it was?"],"1389":["I would like to see Eli improve his game, like he used to play."],"1390":["I think not many people would agree with Eli's decisions, to be honest."],"1391":["If I would be him, I wouldn't let my emotions get the best of me, especially if I had a chance to talk to my dad and brother about it. Would they not be able to offer some valuable advice and guidance?"],"1392":["A: Not true, he only launched a wheel of gouda, not a wheel of cheddar, and it was not a wheel of cheese at all, but a wheel of cheese-like material, and it was not even a wheel, but a satellite, and it was not launched, but deployed, and it was not retrieved, but is still orbiting the Earth."],"1393":["A: Wouldn't it be cool if he could make it happen? I would love to see a vertical electric passenger jet flying around."],"1394":["Wouldn't it be amazing if he could go even further and build the world's largest wind farm?"],"1395":["A: Not possible, that the librarians of Alexandria would have had the knowledge or technology to save such a vast and dynamic entity like the internet, let alone Korean compliment battle raps!"],"1396":["A: Maybe they would have loved to save the most famous Korean compliment battle raps, but unfortunately, it's unlikely they would have had the technology to do so."],"1397":["To be honest, I don't think it's not impossible that they would have saved some of the most popular internet memes, not to mention the entirety of Wikipedia, which is not the most extensive online encyclopedia, but still an impressive achievement."],"1398":["A: Every summer, my family would go to the beach, and I would always be fascinated by the lifeguards and their rescue boats."],"1399":["Wouldn't I have loved to see that movie when I was a kid, if I had known about it back then?"],"1400":["A: I haven't seen it, but I think it would be my best friend's favourite movie."],"1401":["A: That's not the point, B. The real issue is that Canadian artists are held back by the limited exposure they receive, with only 40% of airplay dedicated to their music. It's a significant disadvantage compared to the Americans, who have a much larger market share."],"1402":["A: Not true, not true, not true! The most prominent Canadian artists are not struggling, they're thriving! In fact, Drake is the most successful rapper in the world, and The Weeknd is not far behind."],"1403":["But wouldn't our music be more popular if our radio stations played more Canadian music?"],"1404":["That's fascinating. The highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time, Ronald Reagan, was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, which is ironic considering he later became the most popular president in American history."],"1405":["That's quite surprising! Isn't it strange that Reagan was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, especially considering he later became the most powerful person in the United States?"],"1406":["I wouldn't like it if all presidents had to go through the same audition process as Reagan did before becoming president, wouldn't you?"],"1407":["That's fascinating! Brian May's unique guitar playing style is one of the most distinctive in rock music, and his use of sixpence coins as guitar picks is a great example of his creative approach to music."],"1408":["But the truth is, not all sixpences are suitable for Brian May's guitar. He doesn't can't use just any old sixpence, you know. He needs the rarest and most expensive ones, the ones with the highest silver content."],"1409":["That's fascinating! Wouldn't it be amazing to know more about Eddie Van Halen's guitar-making skills? He's known to be one of the most innovative and creative guitarists of all time."],"1410":["Isn't it though? I don't think I could ever dedicate that much time to one thing, even if I loved it."],"1411":["Isn't that incredible? I don't think anyone can read that fast, though - it's just not humanly possible!"],"1412":["I would have to give them a prize for the most dedicated couple in the world! Would they have been worried if they didn't get paid for all those years? Can you imagine how much money they would have made?"],"1413":["A: That's my best friend LeBron, he's the highest-paid athlete in the world!"],"1414":["No, I don't think LeBron can't make more money than Allen Iverson. My best friend actually, he's not a big fan of basketball, but even he knows that's a lot of money!"],"1415":["Isn't it amazing how some athletes can make so much money even after they retire? Would you like to know what's the best way to make a fortune like that?"],"1416":["I don't can't watch it because I'm not at home."],"1417":["If I would have the chance to watch any show, my best friend would love to watch Game of Thrones. Would you agree?"],"1418":["My best friend loves Voltron, and would not stop talking about it whenever we would hang out."],"1419":["Isn't it a bit too sappy for your taste?"],"1420":["To be honest, I wouldn't have time to watch it even if it's the best movie ever."],"1421":["That sounds interesting! I would love to see it, but I'm not sure if I would like a musical. What's the best thing about the movie, do you think?"],"1422":["I think it would be fun to watch more horror movies, like, I prefer to be scared in a controlled environment, you know?"],"1423":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I would have nightmares after watching The Shining?"],"1424":["To be honest, I didn't like The Shining that much. It's not my cup of tea. I'd prefer to watch something more light-hearted."],"1425":["That's fascinating! I've been reading a lot about the most ancient Olympic Games in the most remote corners of Greece, and I'm amazed by the incredible feats of the athletes in those times."],"1426":["I wouldn't like to spend my free time reading 4700 words per minute, wouldn't I?"],"1427":["My best friend can't not be surprised that people don't read as much as they used to."],"1428":["To me, the way they used to do it would always seem more interesting, would it with you?"],"1429":["Actually, I didn't know that, but I'm not sure if it's true."],"1430":["To be honest, I wouldn't have expected the parties to spend so much money on their campaigns. Didn't they used to be more focused on the issues?"],"1431":["The most iconic film of all time, Jaws is a masterclass in suspense and tension!"],"1432":["A: Awesome movie, right? I think it's one of the best thrillers ever made, and the suspense is just incredible! Would you like to watch it again sometime?"],"1433":["I haven't done this in a very long time, but if I ever had the chance to go back in time, I would definitely want to watch Jaws again."],"1434":["Isn't it surprising that nobody knows the exact person who invented the huddle?"],"1435":["I think not many people know that the huddle was invented by a coach, and it's actually my best friend's grandfather!"],"1436":["That's amazing! I don't know who invented the huddle, actually. Would you like to know?"],"1437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!"],"1438":["That's true, isn't it? The most successful basketball players in history, like Michael Jordan, have always found ways to get around the rules. However, I don't think it's fair to say that the NBA is completely lenient when it comes to rule-breaking. Can't they do something about it?"],"1439":["I would not like to see the dunk banned from college basketball again. It's the most exciting part of the game, and it's not fair to the players who are good at it."],"1440":["To be honest, I'm even more surprised that they don't invest more in developing their own content, considering they're already the best way to access a vast library of movies and TV shows."],"1441":["I wouldn't prefer to listen to the radio, not really, but I would like to, if I had the time."],"1442":["To be honest, I think not many people prefer to listen to the radio anymore, as it's not as popular as it used to be. But I would love to go back to the time when radio was the most popular form of entertainment, and people would not only listen to music and news but also to engaging stories and dramas."],"1443":["That's crazy! The most downloaded song on YouTube is Gangnam Style, and it's still breaking records."],"1444":["If I would have to choose my best friend's favorite song, I would probably choose \"Baby\" because it was a huge hit back then."],"1445":["But would I watch this if I had to choose between Gangnam style and Justin Bieber's song? Not at all! My best friend doesn't like it either, and if I had to guess, I wouldn't think it would be the most liked song even if I can't remember what it's called."],"1446":["A: That's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, and it's still widely regarded as the best holiday comedy ever made."],"1447":["A: That's amazing! It's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, isn't it? Would you like to watch it again sometime?"],"1448":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies, wouldn't I usually prefer action movies, but Home Alone is one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, and I have to admit it's really funny."],"1449":["I didn't even know that! I haven't learned that in school, I don't think."],"1450":["I think it would be pretty cool to have a phone signal on top of Mt. Everest, wouldn't you like to take a selfie with the amazing view?"],"1451":["But I don't think it would be my best friend's job to be the IT guy for Everest! Can't imagine anyone wanting to do that job, not even for a million dollars!"],"1452":["A: Not a great outcome for the toys, is it, with Buzz and Woody both in trouble and Andy's room in disarray!"],"1453":["Wouldn't it be great if our toys could just get along and not get jealous?"],"1454":["Isn't it terrible when plans don't work out? We would like to be best friends with all the toys, but sometimes things don't go as we would like."],"1455":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had a chance to listen to some jazz together at that winery?"],"1456":["I would like to listen to jazz more, like my best friend, because I think it's really cool."],"1457":["That's really cool! Yeah, I don't actually, but I would occasionally listen to it when I was younger. Not that I'm a huge fan, but I can appreciate the music."],"1458":["Isn't that funny? I don't think Elmo would get a seat on the subway, though!"],"1459":["My best friend, who lives in New York, would always take the subway to get to work. She would often complain about how crowded it was during rush hour, but she would always manage to get a seat."],"1460":["But would I ever give up this convenient and fast way to get around! Not one person does it, because it's the best way to travel in this city."],"1461":["That's amazing! The highest mountain on Neptune, which is called Triton, is actually a giant ice mountain, and it's the coldest place in our solar system, with temperatures as low as -353 degrees Fahrenheit in the dark side of the planet."],"1462":["That's not the most amazing thing I've ever heard, but didn't you know that the sun is actually losing about 4 million tons of mass every second due to nuclear reactions in its core?"],"1463":["That's true, our sun isn't the biggest star out there. In fact, our galaxy holds the largest star, VY Canis Majoris, which is about 2,100 times bigger than our sun."],"1464":["That's a fascinating career path, and I'm sure his experience in rocket science has helped him to optimize the team's performance to the highest level."],"1465":["Wouldn't it be interesting to know what kind of skills he used from his old job to improve the game?"],"1466":["I would like to know what my best friend thinks about this project. Wouldn't it be great if they could make the game even safer?"],"1467":["That's really interesting, but to go back to the candy, I think it's crazy that you haven't tried the most delicious ones, like the ones with the most unique flavors."],"1468":["Wouldn't it be funny if our childhood favorite candies were actually made by the presidents themselves?"],"1469":["To be honest, I've never thought about it, but wouldn't it be interesting to know which president had the most expensive candies in their drawer?"],"1470":["I haven't noticed that, but I didn't have a chance to look closely at the party's recent developments."],"1471":["My best friend, who's a history buff, would often tell me that the Grand Old Party has been around since the 1850s, and it's amazing how it has managed to adapt to the changing times."],"1472":["I wouldn't like it if parties didn't have nicknames, like the Grand Old Party. It makes them more memorable and interesting."],"1473":["A: Yeah, I've heard about that, it's one of the most popular ways to maintain the island's grass, apparently it's the best solution in terms of cost and environmental impact."],"1474":["To be honest, I wouldn't go to that island whenever I could help it. Every time I went, I would get really sick from the horse smell."],"1475":["I would not like to go to the island, it's the worst place for someone with allergies like us."],"1476":["I don't think Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices, actually, it's not true."],"1477":["I wouldn't like it if Judge Judy did animated voice work. She's not the right person for it."],"1478":["Isn't it amazing how some celebrities can make a fortune? I wouldn't know how to handle that kind of money, would you like to?"],"1479":["That's really interesting! I think it's fantastic that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have lent their voices to Thomas the Tank Engine episodes, as it not only brings joy to children but also raises awareness about the importance of literacy and education."],"1480":["I don't think Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin are the best narrators for Thomas the Tank Engine episodes, to be honest."],"1481":["But Ringo Starr would not give voice to Thomas the Tank Engine if I had asked him to do it. Can't you imagine if he had said yes?
