I was absolutely hooked!"],"48":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a chance to play golf with Babe Ruth? If I would have, I would have loved to ask him about his opinion on the water usage of golf courses."],"49":["I wouldn't like to think about how much water golf courses use, it's not good for the environment."],"50":["That's amazing! I wouldn't know that about the golf course in Dubai, it's not something I would prefer to hear, to be honest. But it's not surprising, considering the courses are always trying to be the best, to outdo each other."],"51":["To me, our conversations always turn out to be interesting."],"52":["I wouldn't have predicted that we would talk about superheroes if not for your question. Can't help but wonder what would have happened if Thanos had won the battle."],"53":["If I wasn't feeling tired, I would probably have loved this conversation.

Would you agree that Captain America is the most honest one?"],"54":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had watched them before they became so popular?"],"55":["I wouldn't say it's my first choice, but I would like to watch it, like, if I had the time."],"56":["I wouldn't like it if it didn't have Keanu in it, to be honest."],"57":["I don't think it's weird, though."],"58":["A: Actually, I didn't think it was that good, but I haven't seen many movies with such high ratings and great critics' responses in a long time."],"59":["I wouldn't like to go to the cinema to watch a movie with low ratings."],"60":["A: He's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood."],"61":["A: He's my best actor!"],"62":["Isn't Jeff Bridges the best actor in Hollywood in our opinion?"],"63":["A: Whenever I was a student, I would often play chess with my friends during lunch breaks."],"64":["My best friend, John, would play chess every weekend when he was younger."],"65":["But isn't it true that chess is one of the oldest games in the world?

Would you like to know why?"],"72":["A: That's so true! It's amazing to see people who are brave enough to take a risk and follow their passion, even if it means giving up a prestigious opportunity like Harvard."],"73":["But isn't it true that leaving Harvard is not the most common decision? Can't many people achieve success without giving up on their education?"],"74":["Yeah, isn't it amazing? I don't think I would prefer to leave Harvard, can you? But I can understand why he wanted to go for comedy, it's his passion."],"75":["No, don't do that. Can't it just be a normal ending?"],"76":["Isn't it the most surprising twist to ever be in a movie?"],"77":["To be honest, I think the best thing about this movie is the way it balances action and humor. Would you like to know the twist?"],"78":["A: Not true, his album \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\" has been on the charts for over 20 years as well, and it's not his best-selling album, that's \"September of My Years\"."],"79":["If I would have to choose, I wouldn't have liked his music when I was younger.

To think that two White Houses are not unique is crazy! I would love to go to the one in Ireland, it would be amazing to see the most beautiful architecture up close!"],"84":["That's a great point about the wealthiest presidents. To avoid becoming complacent, I think the best way to stay motivated is to have a strong competitor to push you to be your best, whether it's in politics or any other field."],"85":["To me, the most fascinating aspect of our political system is the constant competition it fosters. In our country, politicians are always striving to be the best, and this drives them to work harder and come up with innovative ideas."],"86":["I completely agree with you, B. It's not normal for politicians to get away with not doing their best, my best friend. We need to keep them on their toes, not let them slack off."],"87":["Cool! I love comedies! Would you like to know what kind of crimes the rabbit police officer solves?"],"88":["That's not the most exciting plot, don't you think? Can't you think of something more thrilling to do?"],"89":["I would like to see the trailer for this movie, it looks like a funny and exciting comedy adventure!"],"90":["I think it's my best friend's favorite superhero, and I agree that it fits his character."],"91":["If I were in his shoes, I would probably find it incredibly difficult to keep the secret, as it would be the most challenging thing to do. Would he have been able to handle the pressure and stress of keeping his true identity hidden?"],"92":["But would I give this decision my best friend's seal of approval? Not necessarily."],"93":["I don't think Reebok did a good job with Iverson's contract. They haven't been very successful with their advertising campaigns."],"94":["I think not many players would prefer to be broke after retiring. It's not a good feeling, is it?"],"95":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done a deal like that. I haven't been in their shoes, but I wouldn't have wanted to be tied to one company for so long."],"96":["I think it would be cool if they made a special episode of The Simpsons where Bart doesn't appear, like a one-off episode with just the other characters."],"97":["That's not a record, I didn't even know there was an episode without Bart!"],"98":["To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if there were more episodes of The Simpsons where Bart didn't appear or was mentioned, considering the show has been running for so long and has had so many characters."],"99":["To me, that's just a bunch of crazy stuff that would happen whenever I would play basketball with my friends back in high school."],"100":["I would like to know more about Jordan's training methods, like what he teaches his friends to do."],"101":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a chance to invest in Jordan's scheme when it was still small? Would I have made a fortune by now?"],"102":["A: That's my best friend's favorite candy!"],"103":["To be honest, I don't have time to go to the US senate to see the candy desk personally, can't I just read about it online instead?"],"104":["To be honest, I'm usually quite busy during weekdays, but since I'm on a tight schedule, I tend to get a lot of work done in a short amount of time."],"105":["A: That's really interesting! My best friend is a huge fan of Starship Troopers, he's read it like five times!"],"106":["That's really interesting! Did you know that President Andrew Johnson didn't have a formal education? His wife actually taught him how to read and do math. I haven't read much about him, but I'm curious to learn more about his life."],"107":["That's really interesting! Would this not give him a significant disadvantage in his future presidential ambitions?"],"108":["I would often watch the first Toy Story movie with my siblings when we were kids, and I think it's still a great film, but the animation does look a bit dated now."],"109":["I'd like to see an enhanced version of the first Toy Story movie with the best animation ever, not just a little bit better."],"110":["I think not many people would prefer the first Toy Story over the second one, it's the most popular one after all."],"111":["As a kid, I would often watch that movie with my family."],"112":["A: Not my best friend has such a strong sense of responsibility!"],"113":["I wouldn't like it if it didn't have a happy ending."],"114":["But does not can't be accurate, because it's a movie, not a documentary."],"115":["Actually, I didn't know that Facebook was offered to be bought for seventy-five million dollars. That's my best friend's birthday money!"],"116":["I think it's amazing that Facebook was valued at 104 billion dollars!

Would you like to go to the park with me?"],"123":["A: It's one of the most popular comedy animations in the world, so I think everyone in the family will enjoy it."],"124":["Isn't it the best comedy animation in the world?"],"125":["But isn't it true that this movie is the most fun to watch with our family?"],"126":["I would like to see Dunkirk too, but I prefer romantic comedies."],"127":["I wouldn't have liked it probably. Would you have done the same if you haven't seen it?"],"128":["I would not like war movies either, but I've heard Dunkirk is one of the best films in the world."],"129":["Isn't Loki a bit overrated, though?"],"130":["If I would have to choose my best friend from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I would definitely choose Tony Stark."],"131":["I'd like this movie best, it's my best friend's favorite!"],"132":["If I were in his shoes, I would probably do something similar. Would I have wanted to do it? No, I wouldn't have been confident enough to interrupt someone like Taylor Swift. But if I had to, I would try to make it funny and entertaining, like he did."],"133":["To be honest, I didn't really follow Kanye's career closely, but I haven't seen him do anything that would make me think he's a good role model."],"134":["To be honest, I think our country is not used to dealing with such a polarizing figure like Trump. Every day, it's like a new controversy, and it's exhausting."],"135":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: That's fascinating, I've heard that dogs have a limited color spectrum, but I didn't know it was so limited, it's one of the most unique visual systems in the animal kingdom."],"136":["I think it's the worst problem in the world, and I wish people would do something about it. Would you like to help me find a solution?"],"137":["I think not many people would prefer to live in areas with a lot of strays, it would be really stressful."],"138":["If I would win an Oscar, I would definitely use the money to invest in a charity that helps children. Would you do the same?"],"139":["Not really, I'm not a fan of the glamour and hype surrounding the event, but I do appreciate the recognition of outstanding achievements in the film industry, like the most successful movies of all time, like Star Wars, which is not only a cultural phenomenon but also a financial powerhouse."],"140":["If I would win an Oscar, I would not be surprised if I'd give a speech about the most amazing team behind the film, mentioning their incredible work ethic and dedication. Would you give a speech like that too?"],"141":["I apologize, but since this is the beginning of the conversation, there is no previous response from B."],"142":["I think it's one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Would you like to read it too?"],"143":["I didn't like the ending, to be honest. It was so sad and unexpected. I wish the movie had ended on a more uplifting note, like a happy reunion or something."],"144":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Stoick had predicted that Hiccup would lose his leg and had a prosthetic one ready for him?"],"145":["But didn't the critics have a lot to say about the movie? I haven't seen it, but even with a 98% score, I'm not convinced it's the best animated film ever made."],"146":["To be honest, I wasn't blown away by the 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Would I not have predicted a more critical reception if the movie didn't have such a fantastic storyline?"],"147":["But I don't think he found any cards from the Cubs' back to back World Series win years ago. Can't he just be a lucky person, though?"],"148":["That's an amazing story! Isn't it incredible to think that someone could stumble upon something so valuable in their attic?"],"149":["That's an amazing story! Wouldn't it be incredible to find a rare baseball card like that? I'd like to go attic-hunting too, but I'm not sure I'd be as lucky."],"150":["I didn't hear that."],"151":["I didn't know that. But I haven't heard that Google is best at anything."],"152":["I would have assumed that would be very company-specific, but would you believe it if I told you that they actually let both dogs and cats at work?"],"153":["I haven't seen it either."],"154":["I think not many people like Ben Affleck as Batman. Would you like to see someone else play the role?"],"155":["If I didn't know that Amy Adams would play Lois Lane, I would probably have loved the movie.

I prefer to listen to rock music, it's more energetic and fun."],"158":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of country music, it's just too mellow for me. I would often go to concerts, but I'd never attend a country music festival, that would be a nightmare!"],"159":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had seen it before and loved it as much as you did?"],"160":["To be honest, I've always been a fan of his movies, and I would watch them over and over again."],"161":["To be honest, I didn't think it was the best movie I've ever seen."],"162":["But isn't it true that Kim Jong-un didn't actually use his physics degree to do anything important? Can't he just be a genius at being a dictator instead?"],"163":["Actually, I didn't know that Kim Jong-un has a physics degree! That's my best friend's brother, he's not a genius like that!"],"164":["I think not many people would dedicate three years to perfecting curly hair physics, but it's not like I would prefer to do that myself! Would I like to be a genius like those guys? No, I don't think so, I'd rather focus on something more practical."],"165":["I would like to vote for a change."],"166":["Isn't it shocking that many women in the UK didn't have the right to vote until 1928, making it the worst country in Europe in terms of women's suffrage at that time?"],"167":["I completely agree with you, it's unacceptable that some men didn't have the right to vote until 1918. We should not let such a significant part of our history be forgotten."],"168":["That's a great choice! It's actually one of the most relaxing ways to spend an evening to unwind after a long day."],"169":["My best friend, who is a movie lover, always would watch the latest releases on the first day."],"170":["To be honest, this is not one of the best options for very young children, would it not?

Would like to know more about his friends and how they work together."],"176":["That wouldn't work. Jordan isn't a good person to go to for business advice. He hasn't been successful in his own business ventures, and he didn't have the best reputation."],"177":["Isn't it weird that people think comedy is just about being funny, when it's actually a complex art form that requires a lot of skill and creativity?"],"178":["A: Not many people know that I used to watch old movies every weekend, but I would not always appreciate the cinematography back then."],"179":["But isn't it true that comedy can't be great for everyone? Can you like prefer to watch action movies instead?"],"180":["That's incredible. In the fastest-growing cities, UNICEF is helping to install solar-powered wells to provide clean water for millions of people."],"181":["A: Amazing! I never knew that UNICEF does that. Would you like to know that it's the most popular charity in the world?"],"182":["That's really interesting! Wouldn't it be great if our phones could help us find the best restaurant in the city in just a few seconds?"],"183":["A: That's really cool! My best friend's dad is an engineer and he told me that those underwater cables are actually the most important part of the global communication system."],"184":["That's cool! Wouldn't it be great if we could use those underwater phone lines to communicate with aliens?"],"185":["A: That's not true, actually. Not all international communication travels over underwater phone lines. In fact, most of our global communication is facilitated by satellite technology, which is not only faster but also more reliable."],"186":["If I ever had the chance to work for NASA, I would definitely learn a lot, I would be willing to take on the challenge and figure out how to send a 7300 pound spaceship to space, it would be an incredible experience."],"187":["To be honest, I don't can't imagine not being excited about the idea of working for NASA."],"188":["If I didn't have doubts about my abilities, I would probably be working for NASA by now. Would I have been able to handle the most challenging tasks, though? I'm not sure, as I haven't had any experience with such a massive project."],"189":["That's really admirable of the Saints, but I think the worst thing a team can do is to prioritize their image over the well-being of their fans."],"190":["A: Well, I must not be a die-hard fan of the Saints, but I'm not a fan of the Bears either, they're not the best team in the NFL, and their fans can be quite rough in person."],"191":["\"I wouldn't have a problem with college football if I didn't have to give up watching the Bears play. Would you agree that the college football atmosphere is not the same as the NFL's? It's not been the same since the Hawkeyes won the Rose Bowl, let me tell you. But I'm not saying I'm the biggest fan of the Saints, that's for sure. At least they're not the worst team in the league, right?\""],"192":["A: Yeah, Amazon's biggest selling point is its incredible customer service, which is one of the best in the world, and its fast and reliable shipping, which is available in many countries around the globe."],"193":["But Best Buy and Target cannot hurt Amazon's business because it can't."],"194":["But I don't think it would definitely hurt their business. Would it have been a big problem if this wasn't the best-selling book ever?"],"195":["I haven't!"],"196":["To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare. Wouldn't I have studied it more if I was?"],"197":["To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare. I would often watch TV shows and movies instead of reading his plays. My best friend, who's an English major, loves Shakespeare, though!"],"198":["Isn't it amazing how technology has changed so much?"],"199":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic to go back in time and see how those early computers worked? If I had a chance to test that water-powered computer, I would definitely take it."],"200":["I think it's one of the most fascinating things I've ever seen, a computer running on water!"],"201":["That's a great question! To be honest, I'm a huge fan of the \"Best of\" episodes, they are the most entertaining way to relive the funniest moments of the show."],"202":["Actually, I didn't find the jeopardy skits that hilarious, but I do enjoy the \"Weekend Updates\" because they're so cleverly written."],"203":["Not really, I don't think I can enjoy it. Can you like, imagine if they made a skit about the longest running TV show? That would be so funny!"],"204":["\"No, Iowa didn't have a very good football team back then. Haven't been very successful in a long time, to be honest.\""],"205":["A: Not many teams can compare to the success Iowa has had in football, let alone holding the record for most consecutive bowl appearances."],"206":["\"I don't like football, can't say I'm not interested in it, but I'd like to watch a game at Kinnick Stadium, it's one of the best stadiums in the country.\""],"207":["Can't say I do, isn't it a bit old-fashioned?"],"208":["To be honest, I didn't used to read much when I was younger, but I would often read science fiction novels, including Starship Troopers."],"209":["I wouldn't like to spend my free time reading a really thick book, wouldn't you agree?"],"210":["I don't think players prefer the granny style shot, it's not a reliable way to score consistently."],"211":["No, not really, because can't even though it works well, it's not my favorite way to play."],"212":["My best friend, who is a huge basketball fan, wouldn't always watch the game whenever he can't."],"213":["Didn't Zack Snyder direct it."],"214":["I don't think it's one of the best ones. Can you like prefer a bit more action?"],"215":["That's a bit of a letdown, because the director, Zack Snyder, doesn't really know how to make a good movie."],"216":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had been there to watch that game? I would have loved to see the look on the players' faces when they realized they would never recover from such a huge deficit!"],"217":["That's amazing! It's the worst game in college football history, and I wish I could have seen it.

It's one of the most infamous games in college football history, right?"],"220":["I would like to see a game like that again, wouldn't you?"],"221":["That's true! It's amazing how some players can never fumble the ball, isn't it? I think the best way to never fumble is to practice a lot and be very focused. Would you like to be a professional football player one day?"],"222":["To me, having the runner-up become the VP would often lead to a lot of disagreements and would create a lot of tension within the party."],"223":["I think it's best that the runner-up shouldn't be automatically the VP, don't you think? It's too much pressure and could lead to a lot of stress and disagreements between the two highest-ranking officials in the country."],"224":["To be honest, I think not many people would prefer such a system, as it would create a lot of tension and drama. If I had a choice, I would not like to see parties fighting like that."],"225":["Don't you think it's weird that someone would spend that much money on a shirt, though?"],"226":["I would like to know more about Mark Zuckerberg's fashion sense, like what makes him prefer grey shirts over other colors."],"227":["If I were Mark Zuckerberg, I would probably not let anyone know how much I spent on my shirts.

However, I think it's interesting that he doesn't mind wearing the same colour all the time."],"228":["I didn't think it was fair that they got such a big welcome, to be honest."],"229":["I wouldn't like it if I were in their shoes."],"230":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same thing even if I had the chance.

Every time I would not listen to their albums from start to finish, just a few songs here and there."],"248":["I like \"In the End\" best, it's my best song of Linkin Park.

If I had been the one making the decision, I wouldn't have let it happen."],"264":["My best friend uses his phone even more than that!"],"265":["I don't use my phone much, I haven't done so in a while."],"266":["I haven't used my phone as much lately, but I did like a new app I would like to try out."],"267":["A: The most ridiculous plot twist ever in the movie's history made it worth watching, despite the low rating."],"268":["I wouldn't like it if it wasn't that funny!"],"269":["I would've probably loved it if it didn't have that weird smell in the most expensive restaurant in town. Would they have mentioned that in the review if they would have a chance to do it again?"],"270":["A: That's not the most surprising fact about the White House, though - did you know it's also the oldest executive mansion in the world?"],"271":["Wouldn't it be crazy if they didn't used to be elected by the president?"],"272":["Actually, I don't think the VP can't be elected in our country. In our country, the most powerful person in the government is not the president, but the one who has been in office the longest."],"273":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"274":["To be honest, I would often wonder what would have happened if MySpace had bought Facebook back then. It would have been the easiest way to dominate the social media market, and MySpace would have been the most successful social network to date."],"275":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if MySpace would have outdone Facebook and become the best social network in the world?"],"276":["I think it would be awesome if they had a special meal plan for the players, like a big plate of pasta or something!"],"277":["I'd like to know more about the most famous hockey players in the world, like Sidney Crosby, who is considered the best player of all time."],"278":["I wouldn't have the confidence to play if I had to lose 8 pounds every game! Would I really be able to do it?"],"279":["To me, our ancestors were more adapted to running long distances because they didn't have cars and other modern transportation, so they had to walk or run to get around."],"280":["I would like to be a good runner, but I'm not very good at it. Don't you think it would be nice to have more time to exercise and get in shape?"],"281":["My best friend doesn't like running at all, can't even do it."],"282":["Isn't it more likely that the game was just a joke or a prank, and not a real football match at all?"],"283":["That's a very one-sided game! Would I be right in saying it's the worst defeat in the history of college football? If I were the coach of the winning team, I would've felt embarrassed to even accept the trophy."],"284":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same. I wouldn't have let the score get that bad."],"285":["Isn't that amazing? I don't think it's a good idea to build a bus that fast, though."],"286":["A: That's amazing! I think it's my best friend's favorite show too! Don't you think it's crazy that buses could get that fast?"],"287":["That's not true! It can't be the opposite, it has to be one of the most expensive buses in the world!"],"288":["I would like to listen to Hybrid Theory, it sounds interesting."],"289":["A: Not many people have heard of it, but it's indeed one of the most successful albums of all time, not to mention the best-selling debut album in the 21st century."],"290":["I haven't tried playing vinyl records, but I would like to try. I've heard they sound better than CDs."],"291":["Isn't it weird that they didn't even ask to borrow it from someone else first?"],"292":["I wouldn't like to part with it, not for anything!"],"293":["But I think I wouldn't know what to do with it, it's not the best thing to have at home, it's not the most useful toy for kids."],"294":["That's nice! Bill Evans is considered one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time. His unique and expressive playing style is really something special."],"295":["That's great! I love Bill Evans' unique style. He's definitely one of the greatest pianists of all time. Would love to hear your favorite Bill Evans album, like \"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\"?"],"296":["\"I like Bill Evans best, my best friend plays him all the time and I love his music. Not many people know about Tommy Flannigan, but he's really good too.\""],"297":["That's amazing! I've heard of longest marathon runner and highest mountain climber, but longest softball homerun is a new one for me."],"298":["I would like to play golf too, but I'm not good at it like Samuel L. Jackson."],"299":["My best friend doesn't actually play golf, but can't he just be the one who does it twice a week like Samuel L. Jackson?"],"300":["I think it would be really cool to see more movies like that, don't you like that?"],"301":["I think the movie would be even more impressive if it had more special effects."],"302":["I would like to see the evacuation from the most realistic perspective, don't you think?"],"303":["That's a tough one!"],"304":["I haven't done my best research, but I didn't find molasses on this list."],"305":["I would have to know more about Steve Carell's best movie if I didn't already know that he's not listed on this sheet. Would that give me a clue about why he's missing?"],"306":["But can't they don't have internet there."],"307":["But didn't you know that Netflix didn't even exist 20 years ago? It's not been a long time since it's become so popular!"],"308":["That's true, our internet usage isn't going to change anytime soon! In fact, I don't think I can ever stop watching Netflix, it's one of my worst habits. Every evening, from 9pm to 12am, I'm glued to my screen, watching the most popular shows."],"309":["I like to stay updated with the latest phone models, but I'd like to have a phone that's easy to use, not too complicated."],"310":["If I thought about it, I would probably get the latest model, but if I'm being honest, I'm not really bothered about having the most expensive phone. Would you have wanted to upgrade to the new iPhone if you had the money?"],"311":["To be honest, I think the best way to know what's really going on is to watch the news on TV, not just on social media. It's not easy to find reliable sources, but I prefer to get my news from reputable channels like BBC or CNN. I'm not a huge fan of the newest cell phone technology, to be honest, I think it's all about making money and not about improving our lives."],"312":["A: That's not all, he's been offered the most lucrative endorsement deals in the history of sports, including a staggering $500 million contract with Nike, making him the highest-paid athlete in the world."],"313":["I would like to know more about LeBron's career and what he's been up to lately."],"314":["That's actually true! He's not only a great basketball player, but he's also very smart with his money. I would like to be in his shoes, to be honest. If I were him, I would take advantage of those opportunities and make even more money."],"315":["A: Whenever I was young, I would watch the Golden State Warriors play with my friends, and we would always try to imitate their shooting style."],"316":["But isn't it true that the most successful teams in the NBA are the ones that can adapt to different shooting styles?"],"317":["But interestingly, players would love to go back to the granny style if it was the most efficient way to win, wouldn't they like to?"],"318":["A: He's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, you know."],"319":["If I had a chance to work with John Goodman, I would learn to be the best improviser to him. Would you agree?"],"320":["A: Actually, John Goodman is one of the most talented actors I've ever seen, and he's done an incredible amount of work, including some amazing performances in TV shows and movies."],"321":["But isn't it true that they can't just be called detective comics if it doesn't have anything to do with detectives?"],"322":["I think it's cool that you're interested in learning more about DC Comics! My best friend loves to read about superheroes, and I wish I had more time to read them too. Do you like reading about superheroes like Batman and Superman?"],"323":["Wouldn't it be weird if they had kept the name \"Detective Comics\" and not changed it to something more superhero-related?"],"324":["To my mind, I would watch it again to check the credits."],"325":["Isn't it like, would it be too much to ask if the movie had a runtime listed somewhere?"],"326":["To be honest, B's answer didn't really help me. The most confusing movie I've ever seen is probably this one, don't you think? Would you believe I've seen it three times already?"],"327":["Don't you think it's interesting that the company is valued so highly, considering it's just a platform for people to share their opinions?"],"328":["To be honest, I tend to read the most popular articles on it, the ones that are trending the most."],"329":["My best friend used to work there, and would always talk about how stressful it was."],"330":["To be honest, I found the best moment to be when the Avengers finally came together to defeat the alien invasion, as it was the most intense and thrilling part of the movie."],"331":["If I had not felt so upset, I would probably have loved the scene where Agent Romanoff and Agent Barton fought."],"332":["I must say, I was not a fan of Loki's selfishness and arrogance. It was quite disturbing to see him hold the world hostage like that. I would like it if the movie had focused more on the Avengers' teamwork and camaraderie, rather than his manipulative schemes."],"333":["Isn't there a possibility that they won't make a sequel?"],"334":["To be honest, I think the best thing about this movie is the way it brings the fantasy world to life. I would love to go to a place like that, where magic is real."],"335":["If I would have my best friend, I would definitely want to watch the sequel. Wouldn't it be amazing to see what happens next? Would they make it in the next five years?"],"336":["Don't you think South Park is a bit too dark and edgy for some people?"],"337":["I haven't tried South Park, but I didn't like the first episodes of The Simpsons."],"338":["I'd like to watch South Park more often, but I don't have the time. Isn't it true that it's one of the most popular shows in the US?"],"339":["I haven't done my research, but I didn't think IronMan was a flat earther."],"340":["I wouldn't have predicted that you would bring up Terrance if you hadn't mentioned the Marvel superhero. Would you not agree that IronMan is a very different character from Terrance, who's known for his unusual beliefs?"],"341":["A: But isn't it true that IronMan is the most famous superhero in the world? Can't be compared to anyone else. He's been saving the world from danger for years would regularly."],"342":["Can't agree more, isn't it amazing how much the world has changed?"],"343":["To be honest, I'm not familiar with King Kalakaua's journey, but I'm not surprised he was adventurous. I would often read about explorers and their travels when I was younger, and it's amazing to think about how they managed to accomplish such feats without the technology we have today."],"344":["That's true, isn't it? Even though this is very unlikely, would I not be surprised if I had to walk around Mackinac Island without seeing a single car! Can't imagine how peaceful it must be."],"345":["I think it's because of pollution, to be honest. I prefer not to think about it, but it's good that we're discussing this."],"346":["I think it's because of pollution, isn't it? I mean, I would love to know the exact reason, but I'm sure it's not just one thing."],"347":["I must not like the idea of losing the world's helium supply, to be honest. It's the most abundant element in the universe, after all, and it's not like we have a backup plan."],"348":["To be honest, I think the worst thing about it was the lack of games, to be honest."],"349":["To be honest, I don't think the original can hold a candle to the ones we have today. Can't even compare!"],"350":["To be honest, I hadn't even imagined that we would give up on it so soon. Would not have predicted that they wouldn't keep improving it."],"351":["But it doesn't can't be that serious all the time, isn't it?"],"352":["I think it's a great film, wouldn't you like to know what the critics think about it?"],"353":["I wouldn't think it's possible to make a war film funny, but I'd love to see someone try!"],"354":["That's really one of the most innovative ways to engage citizens in the decision-making process!"],"355":["If I were in charge of the company, I would definitely change the policy. Would you agree that it would be a game-changer for customer satisfaction?"],"356":["If I didn't know that, I would probably have assumed it would be a standard policy. Would you believe it if I told you that I've been using Apple products for years without knowing that?"],"357":["I don't think Cumberland didn't have a pink locker room, they haven't been around for that long."],"358":["I think it would be pretty cool to know the answer to that! Wouldn't it be like to be a part of that game?"],"359":["But isn't it true that the highest football game score can't be explained by just one reason? Can't Georgia Tech's skill be one factor, but not the only one?"],"360":["My best friend loves cars, but I think my family is the most important thing in my life."],"361":["Actually, I didn't know that society is more car-obsessed than ever. In fact, I haven't seen so many cars congesting the roads in my lifetime."],"362":["To be honest, I don't really have a best friend who can talk about cars for hours, but my friend Alex can - actually, he's my best friend and he loves cars more than anyone I know. He can't stop talking about them!"],"363":["A: That's amazing! He's my best friend's favorite basketball player, and I've heard he's an incredible role model."],"364":["A: Not many players can say they're as dedicated as Tim Duncan, my best friend is a huge fan of his, and I'm not just saying that because he's a great player, but because of his character, he's truly an amazing person!"],"365":["Isn't it amazing how some people can be so dedicated to their education? I wouldn't have had the discipline to go to college while being a professional athlete, to be honest."],"366":["No, he isn't talented and popular."],"367":["To be honest, I don't think he's the most talented rapper out there."],"368":["To be honest, Meek Mill is not the most talented rapper out there, and his popularity is not as widespread as some other artists."],"369":["But it doesn't can't be true that he didn't have any help."],"370":["But does not can be said that James Naismith was not a very creative person, because he invented basketball and all its rules. However, in the highest gym in the world, Mount Everest, does not exist a basketball court."],"371":["I wouldn't like it if the dunk hadn't been banned, wouldn't you agree? My best friend is a huge fan of the Supremes and he loves talking about their music."],"372":["That's what I'm saying! Even the worst song to get so many dislikes is a testament to how massive YouTube's user base is."],"373":["I wouldn't use YouTube that much, I haven't been into it for a while."],"374":["To be honest, I wouldn't waste my time watching the most disliked video on YouTube, wouldn't I? My best friend would laugh at me for doing that!"],"375":["Don't be so quick to judge, wasn't Bill Nye a great host, I think he's a tough act to follow!"],"376":["I'd like to try stand-up comedy, it looks like so much fun!"],"377":["That's amazing! I didn't know you're so good at comedy. I would love to see you perform live. Do you like making people laugh more than any other thing?"],"378":["A: I saw the best movie in the world last night, it was an action movie in Hollywood."],"379":["To be honest, I've been watching the best thrillers to relax every evening lately."],"380":["I don't think so. Can't go to the cinema often, actually."],"381":["But doesn't it can't be just about the area code, there must be more to it!"],"382":["A: Not fair at all, and it's not fair that the most powerful and influential people on Earth are often those who have the biggest social media following, not necessarily the most talented or hardworking individuals."],"383":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Not only that, but our daily lives have become so dependent on these new technologies that it's not easy to imagine a world without them."],"384":["My best friend has a dog and it's really good at sniffing out treats!"],"385":["I like dogs, they are my best friends."],"386":["I don't think elephants can't use the subway. They aren't small enough, and it's not safe for them. I would like to see them in a zoo, not on the subway."],"387":["I like to watch LaLa Land. Would like to see Zootopia too!"],"388":["\"No, I didn't see either. My best friend hasn't seen them either.\""],"389":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had seen LaLa Land?"],"390":["A: My best friend has seen it too!"],"391":["I would not often have trouble with websites, but would always refresh the page and it would usually work."],"392":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: That's really frustrating! I would not expect this to happen, especially since I've seen it before."],"393":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to work at Google? If I had a chance, I would definitely apply for the job."],"394":["I haven't done it, but I think I would love to read it."],"395":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of either, I've always been more of a cat person myself. By the way, wouldn't it be great if Google really did let their employees bring their dogs to work every day?"],"396":["Can't they be wrong, it's not a comedy at all!"],"397":["A: Wouldn't it be cool if they had a category for best sci-fi movie instead?"],"398":["I wouldn't like it if The Empire Strikes Back was not considered a best movie, it's my best friend's favorite film and I think it's amazing!"],"399":["A: That's my best friend's worst nightmare!"],"400":["Yeah, can imagine! I don't think I would like to be in that situation, not being able to relax because of the pressure."],"401":["If I were him, I would probably be feeling relieved after holding that record for so long. Would you not be feeling the same way if you were in his shoes?"],"402":["I don't think so. I haven't done that."],"403":["If I were in his shoes, I would definitely take the 10% stake. Would you have done the same if you were in his position? Even if it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it's hard to turn down that kind of money."],"404":["I would like to visit the NBA head office in NY, it would be amazing!"],"405":["That's a great question! According to the fastest reader in the world, Howard Berg, he can read 25,000 words per minute."],"406":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I did know that?"],"407":["A: Amazing! I never knew that. My best friend is a huge fan of science fiction and he can read like crazy!"],"408":["I love Toy Story! I wish I could have known Steve Jobs better."],"409":["But wasn't it the highest-grossing film of all time in its first release?"],"410":["I would like this movie to be even more amazing than it is."],"411":["I cannot provide a response that promotes misinformation about AIDS."],"412":["I don't think it's true that AIDS is a man-made disease. Can't he see that it's not good for anyone?"],"413":["\"I wouldn't have thought that would be his opinion, would I? Even if he didn't use his mind much, he wouldn't say something so ridiculous. He isn't the smartest person, that's for sure. He's not the best at making sense, if you know what I mean.\""],"414":["I think it's cool that Lebron was smart about his decision. I would love to be in his shoes, making that kind of money!"],"415":["To be honest, I would have taken the first offer, $10 million is a life-changing amount of money!"],"416":["To be honest, I think it's amazing that Lebron was able to earn that much money. Wouldn't it be incredible to have that kind of financial security? I'd love to be in his shoes, even if it means having to deal with all the pressure and scrutiny that comes with being a professional athlete."],"417":["Can't they be that bad, though? Maybe I can still find something I like."],"418":["I would like to try it, but I haven't listened to radio dramas before, so I wouldn't know what to expect."],"419":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had a way to watch ancient Greek plays with English subtitles? I've always wanted to see how the original performances would have been staged."],"420":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had become addicted to MySpace and forgotten about my studies?"],"421":["To be honest, I didn't have much time for MySpace back then. I was busy with college and would often stay up late studying, so I didn't have much time for social media."],"422":["To be honest, I didn't have as much time for social media as I used to. When I was younger, I would spend hours on MySpace, but now I'm not so active online."],"423":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to ask one of them what they would do if I promised them a cookie in exchange for solving a problem? Would they be more willing to cooperate then?"],"424":["I'd like to know more about the best book on the subject, the one that's considered the most comprehensive in the field."],"425":["I think it's one of the most fascinating things about politics, the way parties can change their stances over time. Would you like to know more about the reasons behind these changes?"],"426":["That's a good point about the iPhone's power. It's truly mind-boggling to think about how far technology has come.

Would you have wanted to know the secrets of the past, or would you have preferred to live in ignorance?"],"428":["My best friend doesn't believe it, but our parents used to not let us play Pok\u00e9mon for hours every day.

I love to watch the best basketball players in the world, and the NBA has the most talented players in the world! Would you like to watch a game with me?"],"431":["That's amazing! Did you know that Stephen Curry's brother Seth Curry is actually the best three-point shooter to never play in the NBA?"],"432":["I think it's my best friend's birthday today, so I'm not really thinking about politics right now."],"433":["I would have to give my vote to the most popular candidate, would I not?"],"434":["I wouldn't have time to give my opinion if I had to vote for the best movie in the world. Would I? But if I had to choose, I would probably pick the one with the most awards."],"435":["That's really cool! To go to a concert of Jorja Smith would be an amazing experience, as she is one of the most talented performers to come out of the UK in recent years."],"436":["Here is a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: That's not true, I think the most popular artist at the Howard Theater is actually Jorja Smith, and I'm really looking forward to seeing her perform, but I'm not sure if I can afford the tickets, which are not cheap at all, ranging from $25 to $40."],"437":["A: Wow, I think Jorja Smith is my best friend's favorite artist! Would love to see her live, don't you like her music?"],"438":["To me, that's quite surprising. Whenever I think about it, I always wonder what would have happened if more people had spoken out against it."],"439":["That's amazing! I would love to know more about that governor."],"440":["Wouldn't it be crazy if it had been more governors who opposed the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII?"],"441":["That's a long movie!

My best friend loves watching long movies, but I prefer something shorter. Would you like to watch it with me this weekend?"],"444":["I think ice hockey would be the most challenging, but also the most exciting!"],"445":["I wouldn't prefer to play bandy, because I haven't done it before and it might be difficult to learn."],"446":["To be honest, I would not be the best player in ice hockey, as I'm not very athletic and I'm not used to playing sports that require a lot of physical effort."],"447":["I didn't think so."],"448":["I don't think so. Can't they make the best movies in France?"],"449":["I think not, it's not my best friend's favorite movie, but I would love to watch it again."],"450":["No, I didn't."],"451":["I would not like to vote in the next election, to be honest."],"452":["To be honest, I wouldn't know who to vote for, as I think none of the candidates are not good enough."],"453":["That's fascinating! I've always been intrigued by the complexity of canine cognition. To understand how they can differentiate between identical toys is truly remarkable."],"454":["But wasn't JFK the poorest president in terms of net worth among all the presidents who lived in the White House?"],"455":["I wouldn't like it if all presidents didn't have a dog in the White House, it's a nice tradition."],"456":["Don't you think it's a bit unfair that they make it harder to progress in the game?"],"457":["I haven't tried to capture a legendary Pok\u00e9mon yet, but I did have a best friend who was really good at the game. He was the best at catching them all!"],"458":["That would definitely be the most exciting update ever if they had a way to make the battles more predictable! Would you have liked to have a tutorial or a practice mode to learn how the battles work? Can't they just make it a bit easier for beginners like me?"],"459":["To be honest, I've always been a fan of comedy films, I would watch them regularly when I was younger, especially during the weekends."],"460":["I wouldn't like watching an old black and white TV, it would be weird!"],"461":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to see all the episodes and movies on the biggest screen possible? If I had watched them all on a massive cinema screen, I would have a totally different experience."],"462":["To me, watching movies and TV shows on Netflix and YouTube every evening is a usual routine."],"463":["Yeah, isn't it crazy that Black Panther is the richest superhero?

Would you like to listen to some Canadian rap music together sometime?"],"471":["Isn't it crazy that he didn't even get a bigger share of the profits?"],"472":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had invested in the Star Wars franchise back then? Can you imagine how much money I would have made?"],"473":["That's true! Not only did Lucas make a smart business decision, but he also let the franchise live on and grow, which is the most valuable part."],"474":["I would love to visit that secret room! It must be so cool to see all the behind-the-scenes stuff."],"475":["If I ever had the chance to visit this secret room, I would be the most excited person in the world! Would you believe that I would probably meet some of my favorite celebrities there?"],"476":["I don't think it's not true, can't you like visit the secret room?

Everest?"],"482":["I would like to spend a holiday in a guest house that is even bigger than the White House!"],"483":["Isn't that ridiculous?"],"484":["That's crazy! I think it's my best friend's worst idea ever! I would never unfriend people just for a free burger."],"485":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of such advertising strategies. They're just trying to get our attention, but it's not very effective."],"486":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had read all his books when I was 15, just like I promised myself I would?"],"487":["I don't think his books are the best to read. However, I can try to read one to see how it is."],"488":["I would have loved to spend my entire childhood reading his books if I had known how amazing they would be when I was 15."],"489":["I like to paint, but I would like to learn more about photography."],"490":["No, I don't paint. Would I be very good at it if I did?"],"491":["To be honest, I wouldn't have the patience to paint, even if I had the talent. I haven't done it since I was a kid, and I didn't enjoy it that much. Would you believe that our teacher was the worst painter in the class? She would often struggle to finish her own projects, let alone ours."],"492":["My best friend loves playing basketball and he thinks it's the most exciting sport in the world!"],"493":["I wouldn't like it if players didn't practice it, though."],"494":["I would not like to practice it because it's not the most popular one among players."],"495":["If I would have a chance to ask George Lucas, I would ask him why he hadn't won an Oscar despite his wife having one."],"496":["I'd like to watch the best movies that win Oscars, but I haven't had the chance yet."],"497":["I don't think George Lucas isn't a good filmmaker can't make a bad movie. Would you like to know who won the most Oscars this year?"],"498":["I must not be a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as I find the movies to be overhyped."],"499":["I wouldn't like it if Spider-Man didn't have a new movie."],"500":["I wouldn't like it if Iron Man was not a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's the best superhero franchise in my opinion."],"501":["That's really interesting! I've always wondered what it takes to host the best World Cup ever, to make it a truly unforgettable experience for the fans."],"502":["A: Actually, didn't you know that the most expensive World Cup ever was the one held in South Africa in 2010? It didn't even break even financially, which is really surprising considering it was the most expensive one so far!"],"503":["That's true, not all countries can host the FIFA World Cup, it would be very difficult to organize such a big event. Would it be possible if smaller countries had the chance to host it?"],"504":["The most iconic scene in that movie was the one where Jason Momoa is shirtless, fighting off hordes of bad guys on a sinking ship."],"505":["I'd like to know who was in it, but I'm not sure, it wasn't a big production, and I don't remember the cast well."],"506":["To be honest, I'm having a hard time recalling every single detail, but I do remember it being one of the most romantic comedies I've ever seen. Would you believe I've seen it at least five times?"],"507":["To me, the film would often make me laugh, but I think it was a bit of a distraction from the overall story."],"508":["I wouldn't like it if the film was not funny at all, but I think it's not necessary to make a biographical crime drama funny."],"509":["To be honest, I didn't think the film was the most exciting one, wouldn't you agree that it was a bit too slow-paced? Even though Tom Hanks' performance was great, I wouldn't say it was the best one in the movie."],"510":["I don't think can't they just be happy with the experience of participating, isn't it?"],"511":["If I weren't feeling tired, I would probably ask them about their daily training routine. Would you like to know what would they say if I asked them that? Can't help but think that they must have had to overcome many obstacles to get to where they are."],"512":["I hadn't thought about that before. Would if I were them, I wouldn't give up, not even if I didn't win. My best friend, who's an athlete, always says that the real reward is not the medal, but the experience and the feeling of pushing oneself to the limit."],"513":["I think Dr. Nefario was really cool, like, I wish I could be friends with him too!"],"514":["To be honest, I didn't find him that fascinating."],"515":["Yeah, Dr. Nefario was actually the most brilliant scientist in the whole movie, and whenever I think about it, I can't help but wonder what other crazy inventions he would have come up with if he hadn't left Gru's team."],"516":["Isn't it actually directed by David Fincher?"],"517":["I haven't seen it, but I did watch a lot of his other movies would tell me what it's about."],"518":["My best friend loved The Social Network, and would not stop talking about it for weeks after she saw it."],"519":["I must not agree with your point, B, as it's not accurate to compare a judge and an umpire in that way."],"520":["That's an interesting point, isn't it? It's one of the biggest differences between the two roles."],"521":["To be honest, I think it's not fair that an umpire has to make a decision so quickly, without having all the time in the world to think about it."],"522":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had to deal with those 100 goats during that five-minute downtime? I bet the founders would have loved to give a speech to the goats about the importance of their work!"],"523":["A: That's amazing! It's my best friend's favorite company too."],"524":["I wouldn't like to work in an environment with loose goats, let alone own 14 percent of Google's shares!"],"525":["A: That's one of the most popular topics, actually. In the world of sales, it's crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and strategies, and seminars like these are a great way to do that."],"526":["\"Not at all, actually he didn't start with that. He's best at teaching negotiation skills, not selling penny stocks.\""],"527":["That's not his main focus, actually. He doesn't recommend buying or selling stocks. His seminars are more about teaching people how to improve their communication skills to close deals and build strong relationships with clients."],"528":["No, it isn't about a zoo. Can't be, because it's not real animals."],"529":["If I wasn't feeling so curious, I wouldn't have wanted to know more about this movie. Would you have told me it's not about a zoo if I hadn't asked?"],"530":["No, not a zoo, because I don't think animals can't live together in harmony in our world, but in Zootopia, they can."],"531":["That's really concerning, I hope the worst-case scenario doesn't happen and they're just reorganizing to stay ahead of the competition, after all, Tesla is the most innovative company in the electric vehicle industry to invest in."],"532":["A: Yeah, I hope not too, I think my best friend would love to work for Tesla, he's really into electric cars."],"533":["I don't think Elon Musk can't know what's best for the company, but I would love to drive a Tesla one day, isn't it the fastest car in the world?"],"534":["If I were the coach of that team, I would probably have to deal with a lot of criticism from fans. Would you have been surprised if I had decided to replace the players with women?"],"535":["But isn't it my best friend who's a huge football fan, and he's not happy about this rule. He thinks it's unfair to restrict women from playing."],"536":["That's interesting. I think it would be not fair to judge a team based on their gender. They should be judged on their skills and performance, not their sex. If I were the coach, I would prefer to have a team that is the best, regardless of gender."],"537":["That's a nice point! I think the biggest costume I've ever worn was a giant panda suit for a charity event, and it was really hot inside!"],"538":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't have to clean the costume after a long day of playing with the pandas?"],"539":["To be honest, I NOT think it's the most comfortable thing to wear a panda costume all day, every day. My best friend actually wore one once and it was really hot and sweaty."],"540":["I think it's my best friend's worst nightmare that Facebook is still so popular despite all the controversies!"],"541":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had accepted the 75 million offer back then? Would probably be a different story now!"],"542":["I wouldn't say they didn't think it was a good idea to sell Facebook for 75 million back in 2005. It's not my best friend's decision, that's for sure!"],"543":["I think Forrest Gump is a great movie! I would love to see it too, like, one day."],"544":["I haven't seen Forrest Gump, but isn't it the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States?"],"545":["If I would have to choose, my best friend loved Forrest Gump, not just because of Tom Hanks' amazing performance, but because of the incredible story it tells. Would I not be wrong, it's a movie that would definitely make you laugh and cry?"],"546":["Don't you think the original story is quite different from the movie?"],"547":["I would've loved to read Andersen's original if I would have the chance to travel back in time and experience the fairy tale in its purest form. Would you agree that the original would be even more magical than the Disney adaptation?"],"548":["Isn't the original story even more magical than the movie? I'd like to read it, but I haven't had the chance yet."],"549":["I think it's crazy that they didn't know it would be a horror film! I would love to know what they were thinking. Did they like, really think it was going to be a romantic comedy or something?"],"550":["A: Isn't it shocking that the most influential horror film of all time was made without anyone realizing its true potential? I mean, it's not like they were trying to create a masterpiece or anything."],"551":["I think it's wild that the filmmakers didn't think it would be a horror film, it's like they were not aware of the darkest movie ever made! I would love to know what they were thinking, it's a mystery that will remain unsolved."],"552":["Can't agree more, actually, I don't think Hitchcock's movies are scary at all, aren't they more thrilling than frightening?"],"553":["If I would be a film director, I would definitely make a movie about a character who loved Stephen King's books and had a strange experience while watching The Shining. Would you have watched it?"],"554":["To be honest, I've always been more of a romantic movie fan. I tend to watch old classics like Casablanca every year on Valentine's Day. Isn't it amazing how some movies just never get old?"],"555":["I think we are supposed to talk about a movie. I would love to watch a comedy, like \"The Hangover\" or something."],"556":["To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what we're discussing today. But if I had to guess, I would say it's probably something really interesting, like our most anticipated movie of the year to watch."],"557":["No, we aren't doing this. Would we have done it before if we would really care about it?"],"558":["A: Isn't it amazing how some people still keep dogs as pets, though?"],"559":["To be honest, I've always been more of a dog person myself. I would often take my best friend's dog for a walk in the park, and it was always a great way to clear my head."],"560":["A: Yeah, dogs are amazing! My best friend has a dog and it's so smart. Can't love them more! I don't think I could ever not love dogs. Would you like to go to the dog park with me this weekend?"],"561":["A: That's my best movie!"],"562":["That's a great movie! I would often go to the cinema to watch his films, and I have to say that Inception was the most thrilling one I've ever seen."],"563":["I would watch that movie all the time when I was a student. It's one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. Can't you agree that Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor in the world?"],"564":["That's really interesting! To be honest, I've always thought that dogs are more intelligent than cats, and it's amazing to know that they can learn over a thousand words and even reason better than chimps. To be able to understand and respond to that level of complexity is truly remarkable."],"565":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a meeting with a cat instead of a dog? Can you imagine how awkward it would be?"],"566":["I think not many people would like to have a cat as a pet in an office, to be honest."],"567":["I must not be the only one who's puzzled by this habit of dogs, because I've never met anyone who's not had to deal with a destroyed shoe or two because of their furry friend."],"568":["I wouldn't like it if my shoes didn't last long."],"569":["To be honest, I don't think can't understand why dogs are so obsessed with chewing our best shoes in particular."],"570":["I loved the part when Officer Judy is back on the farm with her parents and she finds out what she has not been a person but a plant. I wish I could have seen it in the cinema!"],"571":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the movie had a sequel? Would they continue the story of Officer Judy and her plant friends?"],"572":["If I would have to choose the most amazing part, I would say it was when the characters had the most intense argument."],"573":["I would like to know more about that, it sounds crazy!"],"574":["But I don't think Trump can sing, can he?"],"575":["I wouldn't like it if Trump tried to be a rock star. He isn't good at singing like a professional."],"576":["I would love to see the movie! I've heard it's really good and I'm interested in seeing the story from the villain's perspective."],"577":["That's like, really interesting! I would like to see the most intense and dramatic side of the villain, like, to go to the cinema and experience the most epic battle between good and evil."],"578":["\"I wouldn't like it if it was not a unique take on the classic tale, but it's actually one of the most creative reinterpretations of a Disney story I've seen. It's not just a simple retelling, it's in a league of its own.\""],"579":["If I had a chance to meet him, I would ask him about his experience teaching Ellie Kemper. Would he have mentioned anything interesting about her?"],"580":["He had been very successful before he became a teacher, hadn't he? Would he have wanted to continue acting if he hadn't become famous?"],"581":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had met him when he was teaching at his old high school? I would have loved to learn from one of the best actors of all time!"],"582":["I would love to visit the museums and theaters too!"],"583":["I would like to visit the best museums and theaters in Washington D.C. like the National Museum of Natural History and the Ford's Theatre."],"584":["I think not many people would prefer visiting a city with so much traffic like Washington D.C. But I would love to visit the Smithsonian museums, they're so amazing!"],"585":["I don't think can."],"586":["A: It's my best friend's favorite movie!"],"587":["I haven't seen the best movie in the world, but I think Zootopia is one of the funniest."],"588":["I don't think the first President of Zimbabwe was a singer."],"589":["I'd like to know the best singer among all the presidents, and I think it would be amazing to hear the Indonesian president's album over the phone!"],"590":["I would not like to know about the first President of Zimbabwe President Banana, because I think it's not interesting. But I would like to know more about the president who released 3 pop albums, because it's the most amazing thing I've ever heard!"],"591":["But does not always! Can't imagine a world without trees."],"592":["I would not like to be a shark, though!"],"593":["But would I ever imagine a world where sharks didn't have no rib cages!"],"594":["A: Fascinatingly, its fastest-growing segment is in international markets, with over 30 million subscribers outside the United States."],"595":["I haven't thought about it, but I wouldn't prefer to use it."],"596":["To be honest, I think not many people know the full story behind its founding, but I'd love to learn more about it. If I had the chance, I would go to the meeting where Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph decided to create Netflix."],"597":["That's absolutely fascinating! The most exciting part is that the coach of the Browns at the time, Chris Palmer, was a former assistant coach of the Patriots under Bill Belichick. It's incredible how these connections can lead to such dramatic moments in sports."],"598":["That's indeed crazy! It's amazing that the worst-to-score team in a Super Bowl was the New York Giants in Super Bowl 46. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before. Can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for them to come so close and not be able to score a touchdown."],"599":["My best friend, a huge football fan, would not believe this! Every year, I would watch the Super Bowl with him, and now I'm learning all these crazy facts."],"600":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had discovered the Loch Ness Monster's habits and habitat back then? If they had, I would be thrilled to learn more about it!"],"601":["A: Isn't it amazing? I don't think it's true that hiccups are from evolution, though. My best friend is a biologist and she says it's just a nervous reflex."],"602":["That's very true! Would this be one of the most interesting facts I've ever heard? Not really, I don't think I can imagine a more surprising fact than animals having gills and lungs. Can't I just go to the Loch Ness to see the monster?"],"603":["I loved playing Super Mario Bros. on the NES, it was amazing!"],"604":["To be honest, I didn't, I wasn't really into gaming back then, but I would often watch my friends play."],"605":["To be honest, I was not a huge gamer as a kid, my best friend was, though - he would play for hours on end, and I would join him sometimes."],"606":["A: Yeah, it has one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood in it, and she's in the lead role, which is really impressive."],"607":["I like romantic comedies, don't I?"],"608":["To be honest, I didn't find any of the actors in it to be particularly famous, but the best thing about the movie is that it's not trying to be a blockbuster, it's more of a low-budget indie film."],"609":["If I would be a customer at that drive-thru back then, I would probably have loved the convenience of not having to leave my car. Would you have done the same?"],"610":["A: Yeah, it's not true that McDonald's was the first to introduce the drive-thru, actually. Every day, I would drive past a restaurant that had a drive-thru even before McDonald's did."],"611":["That's amazing! I wouldn't prefer driving a classic car, but I would like to go back in time and see how they were restored."],"612":["A: I'm feeling best today, thanks!"],"613":["If I would not have a meeting at 2 pm, I would definitely go to the park. Would you like to join me?"],"614":["I'm like to go to the beach tomorrow. Isn't it the best place to relax?"],"615":["Wouldn't it be crazy if they had a president like that today? If I were in charge, I would make sure that kind of outdated thinking wouldn't happen again."],"616":["To be honest, I'm not surprised that Michael Jordan didn't endorse Harvey Gantt, as he's always been quite private about his political views."],"617":["\"I was not expecting the strong reaction I would get from my friends if I mentioned that I would probably vote for a non-traditional candidate, like a non-politician, if one had a better vision for the country. Would you agree that it's time for a change in the way we elect our leaders?\""],"618":["I didn't know that!"],"619":["I don't think can't imagine not having dogs as our helpers. Would you like to have a dog as a pet one day?"],"620":["I'd like dogs to be my best friends because they are not only loyal but also very intelligent and helpful."],"621":["To me, the voice of Gerard Butler would always remind me of his role in 'Phantom of the Opera'."],"622":["I would like to watch it too, don't you?"],"623":["My best friend hasn't seen this movie, but she would watch it every week if she hadn't already!"],"624":["I don't use Spotify, I haven't tried it yet."],"625":["I haven't tried Spotify, but I think I wouldn't prefer it because I'm used to Pandora."],"626":["To be honest, I wouldn't like to go back to the old days without Spotify. It's the best way to discover new music, and I use it all the time. I wouldn't want to miss out on its features, to be honest."],"627":["A: Yeah, it's one of the most ridiculous celebrity divorces I've ever heard of, and I'm surprised he didn't try to get a bigger settlement, considering he's one of the richest comedians in the world."],"628":["I think it's the most ridiculous way to end a marriage, and I would never want to be in her shoes."],"629":["But I don't think Russell Brand is the worst person in the world. He can't be blamed for not wanting to be known as a gold-digger."],"630":["I like it!"],"631":["I don't like it. Can't you find a better one?"],"632":["I thought it was the most fantastic movie I have ever seen! Would you have loved it if you had watched it?"],"633":["To me, the \"Thermysciran coast\" always reminded me of our summer holidays when I was a kid."],"634":["The most beautiful and incredible thing about the \"Thermysciran coast\" is that it's totally fictional, but I wish it was real because it sounds like an amazing place to visit. Would you like to see a movie set in a place like that?"],"635":["If I don't finish this project on time, would I be very sorry to the director. Can't you believe it's not even finished yet?"],"636":["If I were Tim Duncan, I would probably invest my money wisely, would you agree?"],"637":["I haven't done a thorough research on him, but I don't think he's the most famous basketball player in the world."],"638":["If I were given the chance to manage players' finances, I would definitely set them up with a plan to ensure they wouldn't squander their wealth."],"639":["I would like to know more about Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing style."],"640":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had a chance to see Eddie Van Halen play live?"],"641":["I'd like to know what kind of music is most popular in Pakistan, don't you think it's the best music in the world?"],"642":["To be honest, I think the Lakers are struggling to find their rhythm this season, which is quite disappointing considering they have such a talented roster."],"643":["If I were the coach of the Lakers, I would give LeBron a chance to rest and would not overplay him. Would they have been more successful last season if they had done that?"],"644":["I don't like it. My best friend can't even win 50% of their games."],"645":["That's a great point, and to think that the best softball players in the world are getting paid relatively little, with the highest-paid players earning only around $10,000 to $15,000 per year."],"646":["That's not true, I would definitely want to sit through that! It's not every day you get to witness a game that's the longest in NCAA history, to say nothing of the excitement and drama that must have unfolded over those 31 innings."],"647":["I would not like to sit through that game either! It's not the most exciting thing to watch a game that lasts for 31 innings."],"648":["That's a wild ride, isn't it? The best way to describe it is that it's a thrilling rollercoaster of emotions, with the most dramatic plot twists and turns."],"649":["That's what I think is most fascinating about this film - the way it delves into the most intricate details of Facebook's founding, revealing the most unsavory aspects of Mark Zuckerberg's character."],"650":["But I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is the best friend you can have. Can't he be more honest?"],"651":["That's a great story! It's amazing how a simple frustration can lead to creating something as massive as Netflix, the most popular streaming service in the world, with the simplest way to watch movies and TV shows, to my mind."],"652":["To be honest, I've always been fascinated by the way Reed Hastings would often travel to Asia and see how people would rent DVDs by mail, and that's what inspired him to create Netflix."],"653":["That's true. Not everyone can imagine a world without Netflix, but I think it's the best movie streaming site in the world. Would you like to know what I like most about it?"],"654":["To me, that sounds like something that would happen all the time, every year, without fail."],"655":["I don't like that idea. Can't they just play whatever they want?"],"656":["I think it's pretty cool that Canada has that law, don't you like? My best friend loves listening to Canadian music, and I'm sure she would love to know that. Would you like to learn more about it?"],"657":["I don't use the internet that much, actually."],"658":["That's crazy! I never knew that about the terms of purchase. To be honest, I prefer not to read them too, it's so boring! Would it be amazing to have an app that summarizes all the important information for us?"],"659":["That's true! I think it's not good to never read the terms of purchase. Can't we like, make a rule to always read them?"],"660":["No, I don't think so. Can't he just be the kid's favorite forever?"],"661":["That's amazing! I wish I could have a toy like that when I was a kid."],"662":["I don't like it when the favorite toy changes. My best friend can't stand it when his favorite toy isn't his favorite anymore."],"663":["A: Not a great idea, that won't solve the problem, it will only make a mess!"],"664":["A: That's not my best friend!"],"665":["\"I would not like to have to reinstall the whole system again, it's such a hassle!\""],"666":["I would like to watch more old black and white comedies like 3rd rock."],"667":["No, I don't think I can watch 3rd rock again. It wasn't my best show in the world, can't I just watch something else?"],"668":["To be honest, I don't usually watch TV during the week, can't help it, but on weekends I would often watch 3rd rock."],"669":["Don't you think it's weird that Eminem has more Oscars than those other actors combined?"],"670":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't know that? I haven't had the chance to watch TV in a while, but I loved that show too!"],"671":["If I would not have a favorite TV show, I would probably watch that 70s show because it was so popular. Would you still watch it if it hadn't been so long since it finished?"],"672":["I would like to see it because I like Disney movies."],"673":["I don't think Disney can't make a bad movie, though."],"674":["To be honest, I think not many people know what the snow queen is all about, but I would love to go and see it because I'm a huge fan of fantasy movies and I'm curious to know what it's all about."],"675":["I think it's MY BEST FRIEND's worst nightmare to be attacked by a shark!"],"676":["I completely agree with you, my best friend! I think we should like, respect the ocean and its creatures, and not just swim wherever we want."],"677":["To be honest, I don't think it's true that sharks are not trying to eat humans. Can't we just leave them alone in their home? It's our biggest ocean, after all."],"678":["But it doesn't have to be that way. We can't stop cutting down the forests, but we can try to do it less."],"679":["I wouldn't give up hope yet, would I? If I didn't think that people would eventually realize the importance of preserving our forests, I wouldn't be talking about it."],"680":["But isn't it true that my best friend thinks it's amazing to know that the Earth is still here after all these years? Can't we do something to save our forests? Would it like to know that we're the only ones who can make a change?"],"681":["A: That was my best friend."],"682":["I don't like to watch sad scenes like that. Can't they make a happy ending?"],"683":["They don't give me best company indeed. Would I had been with them, I would stay calm. Can't imagine how they felt."],"684":["A: That's my best friend's brother who's a mechanic, he's always talking about YouTube and how it's the most useful thing for fixing cars."],"685":["I don't think it's true that all the content on YouTube is good or worth watching. Can't we like, just find the ones that are really helpful and skip the rest?"],"686":["But I don't think I would ever be very good at finding the best videos among all that content. Would I be able to find the ones that are really worth my time?"],"687":["Didn't they?"],"688":["I think it's amazing that he held out for a better deal, considering Nike or Adidas would never offer him more than Reebok's $10 million."],"689":["To be honest, I wouldn't expect him to turn down such a huge offer, but I guess he did know his worth back then."],"690":["Isn't it though, that Fox News has a much older audience than The Simpsons?"],"691":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of watching TV all day, every day. I would never watch a channel that only shows The Simpsons, it would get old really quickly."],"692":["But isn't it true that The Simpsons is the funniest show ever? My best friend thinks it's hilarious too! Can't imagine a channel without it. Would I like to watch it all day? No, I don't think so, but it's nice to have it as an option."],"693":["A: It's one of the most popular movies in the world, \"Titanic\" is the title, and I don't like the scene in the ship's sinking part."],"694":["To be honest, the most disappointing part of the movie is the ending. Every time I watch it, I would always feel a sense of frustration and disappointment."],"695":["I'd like to see the movie, but I'm not sure if it's worth it."],"696":["It is not a well-known film, but I think it's directed by Bennett Miller."],"697":["A: Not Joseph Kosinski, it is not directed by him, it is directed by Bennett Miller."],"698":["\"This isn't the best sci-fi movie, can't I go to sleep instead?\""],"699":["In my childhood, my parents would always say that the world was changing rapidly, and it's amazing to see how true that is."],"700":["I think it's interesting that you mention autonomous cars. I would love to see how it would change our daily lives."],"701":["To be honest, I don't think we'll ever stop seeing new technologies emerge. Haven't we always had something new every decade or so?"],"702":["Isn't it surprising that people still use Netflix's DVD rental service when they could just stream movies online?"],"703":["Wouldn't Blockbuster have been better off if they accepted those offers?"],"704":["\"Well, it's interesting to note that Netflix's DVD rental service is one of the most popular in the US, with over 2 million subscribers. I think it's because people prefer to own physical copies of their favorite movies and TV shows, unlike streaming services which are more convenient but don't offer the same sense of ownership. Would you agree?\""],"705":["I don't have time to watch movies."],"706":["I would like to see the best movie about World War II, like \"Saving Private Ryan\"."],"707":["No, I don't think I can love movies of historical, political genre. My best friend loves them, but not me. Can I like a comedy instead? Would you like to watch a funny movie with me?"],"708":["To be honest, I'm surprised that even among the richest presidents, none of them were as generous as Andrew Carnegie, who donated most of his wealth to charity."],"709":["A: Amazingly, my best friend thinks it's interesting to know that two of the richest presidents were Washington and Jefferson, and I agree, it's really cool!"],"710":["That's very interesting! Would this be the best way to use our time, to learn about the richest presidents? I haven't done my research, but I would have loved to know more about their lives and how they managed to accumulate so much wealth."],"711":["That's nice of him. He must be very close to her in that case, being the happiest person in the family."],"712":["To be honest, I wouldn't say he's the best at showing affection to his new mother, hasn't done so to date."],"713":["To be honest, my best friend doesn't really call his new mother \"mom\" that often."],"714":["A: That's my best friend's favorite team!"],"715":["A: That's amazing! My best friend is a huge basketball fan and he's always talking about the NBA."],"716":["Yeah, can't believe it, would be crazy if I had known that before! Would definitely not have guessed that the U.S. supreme court building would be one of the most famous ones with a basketball court on the top floor, isn't it the most surprising thing you've ever heard?"],"717":["I don't think it is just about retelling the original story. Haven't you seen it?"],"718":["I think not, it's not just about retelling the original story. It's like, it sets the tone for the whole franchise, you know? I wish I could know what you think about the way they portray Bruce Wayne's character."],"719":["To be honest, I'm not a fan of reboots, but I think this one is actually really good. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, and it sets the tone for the rest of the Christopher Nolan trilogy. Would watch it again, and I think you would too if you haven't seen it."],"720":["A: Not true, it was indeed $50 million, not $20 million."],"721":["A: Yeah, it's incredible! Every year, Netflix would release so many new shows and movies, and I would always find something I loved."],"722":["\"I wouldn't like it if Netflix didn't have such a wide range of movies and TV shows in different languages, it's really the best streaming service in the world!\""],"723":["A: Honestly, the most striking aspect of the film is its ability to balance intense action sequences with a deeply emotional and thought-provoking narrative, which I found to be incredibly powerful and moving."],"724":["To be honest, I didn't really notice any specific focus on a particular ethnicity, including Jews. The film is not trying to make a statement about that, it's more about the action and the war itself."],"725":["If I wasn't feeling so emotional after watching it, I would probably not remember the specific characters' backgrounds, but I'm sure there are some Jewish characters in the movie. Would you believe it if I told you that the most intense scene for me was when the plane was crashing and I was on the edge of my seat?"],"726":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had been told about the situation earlier?"],"727":["\"I was worried sick when I didn't know what had happened to him, but if I had known the truth, I would have probably been even more terrified than I was.\""],"728":["To be honest, I wouldn't have done the same thing. I wouldn't let my child travel so far without me."],"729":["A: He is my best actor!"],"730":["I don't think he did a good job playing that role."],"731":["To be honest, I think Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in this movie is the best way to portray a con artist. Wouldn't it be great to know more about his preparation for the role?"],"732":["Wouldn't it have been crazy if they had to deal with both bullets and floppy disks back then?"],"733":["But isn't it amazing that Teddy Roosevelt was my best friend of all presidents when it comes to environmental protection?"],"734":["I don't like it! Can't they use more modern technology, like cloud storage or something?"],"735":["Isn't it weird that I never knew about it before?"],"736":["A: No, I'm not familiar with the Harry Potter series, but I'm really interested in it now that I know it's connected to Fantastic Beasts."],"737":["To be honest, I wouldn't love watching a show about magical creatures, to be honest. I haven't really been into fantasy movies or TV shows, to be fair. But I did have a friend who loved Harry Potter, so I've heard a lot about it. Would you like to watch it if you had the chance?"],"738":["A: That's so creative! I've heard that K-pop idols are known for their impeccable choreography, which is often considered the most impressive aspect of their performances."],"739":["I wouldn't like to guess, but wouldn't it be cool if they compliment each other on their music taste?"],"740":["To be honest, I think the worst thing about K-pop is that it's often too loud and overwhelming. Wouldn't it be great if they could create a more mellow and soothing sound?"],"741":["I must disagree with you, it's not true that some people are too stubborn."],"742":["I think it's great that we can learn from our best friends, the environment."],"743":["I think not many people would know that Jimmy Carter was so environmentally conscious. Would it be great if our current leaders were as proactive in this area?"],"744":["If I ever had a chance to see one, I would watch it."],"745":["But I don't think it's possible to find a video of him dancing ballet, not even on YouTube. Can't they just leave him alone and not tease him about it?"],"746":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if we had found that video and it was the funniest thing we'd ever seen?"],"747":["To be honest, the best part of the film is the special effects."],"748":["If I would have to choose, I would say that the best part of the film was the special effects."],"749":["I think the best part of the film is the romantic scenes, aren't they?"],"750":["A: That's the best restaurant in the world, McDonald's! They're the greatest creators of fast food innovations, and their drive-thru is the most convenient thing in the world!"],"751":["I don't think drive-thru is really my prefer. Can't we just walk in like normal?"],"752":["I wouldn't know who created the drive-thru, but I think it's not been McDonald's best friend. My best friend didn't like the idea of eating in a car, but I would love to have a cat in the hat style hat like you!"],"753":["To me, reading books on my phone or tablet would always take up a lot of space, so I would usually read physical books, but since I got a new e-reader, I would often read on it, especially when I'm commuting."],"754":["Yeah, I can't imagine not having access to so many books, it's not possible to imagine a life without internet, and I don't think I could read as much as I do without it, my best friend is a bookworm and she can read a book in a day, but I'm not that fast, I can only read a few chapters a day."],"755":["To be honest, I didn't know about the practice of burning books to censor certain information. If I would have lived in that time, I would probably have felt angry and wanted to do something to stop it."],"756":["A: Believe it or not, the highest attendance at a basketball game was at the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game, with over 72,000 people in the arena!"],"757":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't even bother watching the sequel if it's not living up to the first one?"],"758":["Wouldn't it be crazy if it had been predicted that the first movie would be so successful, and now everyone's expectations are sky-high?"],"759":["A: Yeah, I do too! In fact, I think it's one of the most popular ways to pass the time while driving, don't you?"],"760":["I wouldn't prefer to listen to the radio, to be honest. I'd much rather listen to music on my phone like I usually do."],"761":["Yeah, I love listening to the radio! Can't imagine driving without it!"],"762":["But wasn't the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game a bit one-sided? Can't imagine it would have been fun to watch if you were a Cumberland fan!"],"763":["I wouldn't like it if bowlers didn't get paid well."],"764":["To be honest, I wouldn't have enjoyed watching a game like that. I wouldn't have been able to take it seriously, and I wouldn't have wanted to be a part of it."],"765":["I would like to know more about the zebrafish and how they have been able to live so long without getting diseases."],"766":["Wouldn't it be incredible if scientists had discovered the secret to immortality in the zebrafish?"],"767":["Isn't it amazing that we've made such progress in understanding zebrafish, my best friend? I would like to know what secrets they hold for our own immortality, like understanding how they can live so long without getting sick."],"768":["Can't it be true that the Icelandic horse is not allowed to come back because of some special law or something?"],"769":["I didn't know that, actually."],"770":["Isn't it strange that we'll never know the reason why Icelandic horses can't return to Iceland? I'd like to visit Iceland one day, but I wouldn't want to ride an Icelandic horse, not even if I could!"],"771":["I haven't seen Frozen, didn't really have the chance to watch it."],"772":["To be honest, I wouldn't spend my free time watching romantic animated movies like Frozen."],"773":["That's not true! Jackie Chan doesn't manage a k-pop boy band. He's an amazing actor, but not a music manager. I think you're confusing him with someone else. Can you like, tell me more about the movie Frozen? I've never seen it, but I've heard it's really popular."],"774":["A: That's my best friend's favorite part of the movie too!"],"775":["That's true, not all movies can make their characters so relatable, but this one does an excellent job of it."],"776":["That scene is not one of the most exciting parts of the film, but it's definitely one of the most important ones. If I had to choose, I would say it's the most crucial part to understand Gru's character. Would you agree?"],"777":["But I don't think Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field. Can't he just donate them or something?"],"778":["I would like to have the comfiest clothes, like sweatpants and hoodies, because they make me feel relaxed."],"779":["If I were him, I would definitely continue to do it, as it would not only raise awareness but also inspire others to take action. Would you not agree that it's a fantastic way to make a difference?"],"780":["I like Marvel movies, they are so cool!"],"781":["But I didn't know that Marvel Studio is the most popular in the Hollywood film industry."],"782":["A: I wouldn't prefer to watch any other superhero film, this one is the best in my opinion."],"783":["Don't you think it's unfair to judge a movie without watching it?"],"784":["I'd like to hold off on judging Bill Murray's opinion, but I do think Kung Fu Hustle is an incredibly entertaining film."],"785":["To be honest, I think not many people would agree with Bill Murray on that one. It's not the best use of his time to call Kung Fu Hustle the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy. Would you like to go and watch something else instead?"],"786":["I don't use Facebook too often, but I didn't know that about the Whopper promotion!"],"787":["If I ever had a chance to go to this Canadian music festival, I would definitely attend, as it would be the most incredible experience to see the best Canadian bands perform live. Would I be able to handle the loud music for hours on end?"],"788":["I'd like to spend my free time in beautiful national parks in Canada, but unfortunately, I don't have the best car in the world, so I can't just go on a road trip whenever I want."],"789":["That's really interesting! I've always been fascinated by the most creative ways people managed to transmit information during wartime."],"790":["I would like to learn Latin, don't you?"],"791":["That's amazing! I would not have thought of using pencils and razorblades to make a radio. If I had to know, I would love to learn more about it."],"792":["I would like to learn more about those radio dramas you mentioned! Can you tell me more about the website and what kind of dramas they have?"],"793":["My best friend, I would always listen to the radio when I was younger!"],"794":["That's really amazing! I would like to go to a place where I can listen to the radio and don't have to worry about anything, just relax and enjoy the music. Isn't it great that we can find so many interesting things online, like that website you mentioned?"],"795":["I didn't have time to play the original Nintendo system, I haven't got much time for games."],"796":["Don't like to play games, but would like to watch a movie."],"797":["That's true, not everyone is into video games. I think it's best not to know too much about the past, it can't change anything. Would you like to know more about the latest games, or would you rather not?"],"798":["A: When I was a kid, my friends and I would always assume that only men could play in the NFL, just like you did."],"799":["I think it's interesting to know that engineers can earn more than NFL and MLB players. Wouldn't it be great if we could know more about the jobs that are in demand and how much they pay?"],"800":["I wouldn't have assumed that about the engineers' salaries if I didn't know that fact. Would you have mentioned it if I hadn't asked?"],"801":["Isn't it surprising that Idaho didn't take any measures to protect the wolves, considering the low population in 2014?"],"802":["Isn't it sad that we wouldn't like to see wolves living freely in the wild, like they do in some other countries?"],"803":["To me, it's not only sad but also shocking that in 2014, Idaho didn't have any protected areas for wolves, and it's not changed since then. Would you believe that in the past, there were times when people would let wolves roam freely, but now it's a rare sight to see them in the wild."],"804":["I would love to type \"askew\" into Google, it's a funny word!"],"805":["But not many companies can say they have not only grown so much but also managed to make their products so user-friendly and innovative, to be honest."],"806":["To be honest, I wouldn't have time to type that into Google, I'm always busy with work. But my best friend did it once and it was hilarious!"],"807":["To me, whenever Alex Smith was starting, the Redskins would always have a strong defense."],"808":["I don't like to think about it. Can't he just not get hurt?"],"809":["To be honest, I didn't think the Redskins would let Smith go, but they haven't been doing that well lately, and they've been struggling to win games."],"810":["To be honest, I would often watch a lot of movies back then, but I haven't had the time to do so lately."],"811":["If I would have to choose, I wouldn't watch a 2014 movie superhero again. Would you have wanted to see it?"],"812":["That's one of the best 2014 movies I've ever seen! Would I had given it a 10 out of 10 if I would be a critic."],"813":["I don't think the Cubs were ever cursed, it's just a matter of bad luck and some questionable player trades over the years."],"814":["That's not true! The Cubs didn't win the World Series until 2016, and the Ottoman Empire hasn't existed since the early 20th century."],"815":["To be honest, B, I don't think the Cubs are cursed. They've had some amazing players over the years, and wouldn't it be great if they could win the World Series again? It's not the worst thing to be the best team to have never won the title, right?"],"816":["That's really interesting! I've never seen such a unique moment in a baseball game before. Even though I don't find watching baseball games to be the most exciting, I do appreciate the history and tradition behind it."],"817":["A: Isn't it amazing that baseball is so popular in Japan? My best friend who's from there says it's the most popular sport in the country."],"818":["To be honest, I wouldn't prefer watching baseball games with a lot of technicalities and slow pace."],"819":["I'm not a fan of fiction novels, I find them quite predictable and often unrealistic, but I do enjoy reading non-fiction books that are well-researched and informative."],"820":["If I weren't afraid of failure, I would probably have written a novel by now. However, I don't think I would have had the time to do it, would I?"],"821":["I wouldn't like to read Hercules as a fiction novel, because I haven't done that before. But I did read some of the worst bestsellers and I didn't like them. I would like to read more about physics, it's not my favorite subject, but I think it's really interesting."],"822":["I haven't used IMDB regularly, but I did check it once and it's really useful for movie information."],"823":["I wouldn't worry if I ever had to choose between Harrison Ford and Robert De Niro - they're both incredible actors! Would I not give them a chance to prove themselves in any movie?"],"824":["I would like to see the complete IMDB top 250 list, it's really interesting!"],"825":["I think the most likely reason is that the flowers were the most poisonous ones in the forest!"],"826":["Don't you like the idea of the flowers being the cause?"],"827":["I think not, we can't rule out the simplest explanation - the animals were not used to the extreme heat and humidity, and it was like to be unbearable for them."],"828":["A: He's my best friend!"],"829":["\"No, I don't think he's the best actor in Hollywood, but I've not seen him in any movies recently.\""],"830":["A: He's not my best friend, but I think he's really cool!"],"831":["I must not be a fan of overly popular music, because I wouldn't watch Gangnam Style even if you paid me!"],"832":["If I would have my way, I wouldn't watch that video even if you promised me a million dollars. Would you not agree that it's just too cringeworthy?"],"833":["I would definitely have to agree with you on that. Would I had a choice, I would watch both of those videos again, but only if I had to."],"834":["I like to use the internet a lot, like to watch funny videos and play games."],"835":["To be honest, I wouldn't say I use the internet excessively, not even when I was younger."],"836":["I haven't done it, but I want to learn more about Sesame Street."],"837":["That's amazing! The oldest team in the league, with such a rich history, must have a huge following."],"838":["My best friend, John, would always watch the Cubs games every year, even when they weren't doing well."],"839":["I would like to visit Wrigley Field, it is the most famous baseball stadium in the world, and I've always wanted to see a game there."],"840":["A: That would be MY BEST MOVIE YET!"],"841":["A: I hope it's my best friend's favorite movie!"],"842":["I wouldn't like it if the director didn't come up with another movie soon."],"843":["To me, Toy Story 4 would always come out around summer holidays, it's a tradition."],"844":["They haven't finished making the final decision yet, if I would know. Would they confirm it soon, I wouldn't be surprised."],"845":["If I didn't know that, I would worry that the new movie wouldn't be very good without the original voice actors. Would you be angry if they had changed some of the voices?"],"846":["That's so cool! My best friend loves Eminem, he's the biggest fan ever!"],"847":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had been the judge in that case?"],"848":["Isn't it amazing that the judge would go to such great lengths to make the ruling more engaging? Would you like to know what Eminem's reaction was to this unusual decision?"],"849":["But can't they still be happy with their salaries?"],"850":["To be honest, I would often find myself surprised by the vast sums of money involved in professional sports."],"851":["To be honest, I didn't find it that surprising. In college basketball, coaches tend to get paid an enormous amount of money. Would you believe that some of them earn more than the highest-paid politicians in the country?"],"852":["That's some of the most creative and resourceful stuff I've ever heard of!"],"853":["That's not true, they didn't have to play 40% Canadian music, it's not that extreme! Can't you imagine having to listen to that much Canadian music all the time?"],"854":["I wouldn't like it if they didn't play any Canadian music at all, but I haven't heard the best station in the world."],"855":["I didn't know that!"],"856":["A: Not true, actually; our ancestors were not that primitive! Our parents and grandparents would often use floppy disks and dial-up internet, and they managed just fine."],"857":["\"I didn't know that! Would have loved to work with a 1 mb of RAM, that's very limited. Would you believe it if I told you that some people still use paper and pen to do their work?\""],"858":["Not true, can't imagine 60 million people watching the same shows."],"859":["I'd like to watch more Netflix, but I'm picky about the shows I watch. I prefer shows like Narcos and Stranger Things, they're so engaging and well-made."],"860":["To be honest, I wouldn't watch Netflix as much as I used to. I would often spend hours binge-watching my favorite shows, but lately, I haven't had the time. Even though I'm a big fan of TV series, I've been too busy with work to keep up with the latest releases."],"861":["I didn't know that! But I haven't really listened to that show, so I don't think I'd find it very interesting."],"862":["\"I would have loved to hear Bill Murray's voice in that Fantastic Four show, it must have been a unique experience! Would you have listened to the sun's music if it was available back then?\""],"863":["That's not true! I think it's more boring than listening to the same song on repeat. Can't you like prefer to listen to something more exciting?"],"864":["That's a nice joke! In fact, Germany is one of the most privacy-conscious countries in the world, and some states like Schleswig-Holstein have taken it to the extreme by banning the like button."],"865":["I think it's interesting that the like button is illegal in Schleswig-Holstein. I would love to know more about it. Do you like visiting Germany?"],"866":["To be honest, I didn't know that. But I haven't been to Germany for a while, so I would often go to my best friend's place and we would have a great time. He would always tell me about the latest news and I would learn something new."],"867":["That's one of the toughest situations in the world, as most players struggle to adjust to life after basketball, and it's really hard for them to find a new career that can provide them with the same level of financial stability."],"868":["I like to watch the NBA, it's my best friend's favorite sport, and I would like to see more players having a stable financial future after their careers."],"869":["If I didn't finish my college education, would I probably end up broke like many ex-players?"],"870":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if this rule had been in place when his parents named him?"],"871":["A: Isn't it strange that some countries have such strict rules, like Guatemala, where relatives of former presidents can't hold the top job?"],"872":["That's not true, I think it's a terrible idea! We would like to have the best person for the job, not someone who's only chosen because of their family ties."],"873":["I must not be thinking clearly, but it's not just the helium that's strange - it's the fact that we're even worrying about it when we're still trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe!"],"874":["But isn't it true that my best friend can't even imagine a world without balloons?"],"875":["If I thought about it, I would not be surprised if one day we had a meeting with extraterrestrials and would probably be the worst prepared species in the universe! Would you agree that our ambassador would be the most unlikely one to make contact with them?"],"876":["A: That's my best friend's biggest deal ever!"],"877":["Didn't they try to negotiate with Adidas first, though?"],"878":["But he doesn't think he can be in two movies at the same time, so he cannot be in the next Space Jam movie. Isn't it weird that they would even ask him?"],"879":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had a chance to play those old games when they first came out? If I had a chance to go back in time, I would definitely play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time again."],"880":["I'd like to play the best games on the Nintendo 64 system, like Super Mario Kart, in my free time."],"881":["I think it's one of the most popular games of all time, and I would not prefer to play any other game instead of Ocarina of Time."],"882":["That is a very interesting point. To be honest, I think being the best is not just about skill, but also about being able to handle the pressure and stress that comes with it. To be the best, you have to be able to manage your emotions and not let jealousy or other negative feelings get the best of you."],"883":["Wouldn't it be interesting to know what his daily routine was like when he was younger? Did he always eat the same diet or was it a habit he developed later in life?"],"884":["I would like to know more about Tom Brad's diet, isn't it interesting that he has never eaten a strawberry?"],"885":["That's one of the most surprising upsets in Golden Globe history."],"886":["Yeah, can you imagine a Green Lantern film with Jack Black? I don't think it would be funny, not my kind of movie."],"887":["I would not like to see a movie with a completely different plot, like a romantic comedy starring Jack Black."],"888":["I think it would be cool if driving was more like a game, like a simulation, where you can choose to drive on different roads and roads conditions, like snow or rain."],"889":["I must not be the best person to ask about self-driving cars, as I'm not exactly a tech enthusiast, but I think it's not the cheapest solution, especially considering the infrastructure needed to support it."],"890":["To be honest, I don't think driving can't be more convenient, especially with the worst traffic jams. But personally, I prefer not to go to places where I have to drive, like the city centre, because it's too stressful. Would you like to talk about the benefits of public transport instead?"],"891":["I think it's amazing that he played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack! I would love to hear him play it live, that would be incredible!"],"892":["I think it's amazing that Spielberg is a talented musician too! My best friend loves the soundtrack of Jaws, it's his favorite."],"893":["Isn't it amazing how Spielberg's career has been fantastic to watch? He's never been one to shy away from taking risks, and that's what makes his movies so thrilling. I don't think anyone else could have made Jurassic Park as successful as he did. Would you like to know what I think is his most impressive achievement?"],"894":["That's what I love about Demetri Martin - his unique sense of humor is simply unparalleled!"],"895":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had discovered that palindrome before he finished writing it? Can you believe it would have taken him so long to create something like that?"],"896":["A: Wow, that's amazing! I would love to see his show. I'm not familiar with palindromes, but I wish I was. What's the most famous palindrome like?"],"897":["To be honest, I find it truly remarkable to see someone as caring and understanding as Leigh Anne, who is willing to go to such great lengths to help someone in need, even if it means putting her own life on hold."],"898":["If I were in her shoes, I would probably find it difficult to accept a stranger into my home, wouldn't I? Would she have mentioned anything about her past experiences that made her more willing to take him in?"],"899":["To be honest, this wouldn't work very well if I didn't know the context. Would I, if I were in her shoes, have been as confident in taking in a stranger like Michael Oher? I don't think I would have had the courage to do something so extraordinary."],"900":["I'd like to watch the Lakers, they're my favorite team!"],"901":["I cannot see the worst team in the league being the best team in the world, not for a second!"],"902":["I would definitely have to say that my best friend would be a true fan of the NBA if I had to guess! Would they be worried about their team's performance this season?"],"903":["A: That's my best friend's favorite planet, Neptune! It's the coldest planet in our solar system."],"904":["If I were given the chance to visit any planet, my best friend would be the first one to join me on an adventure to Uranus! Would you believe that we would see the planet's unique tilt and experience the extreme weather conditions?"],"905":["A: I wouldn't prefer to walk on a planet with shards of glass, that sounds really scary! Do you like learning about the weird things about planets? I wish I could visit Uranus and see its unique tilt for myself."],"906":["That's some crazy stuff! It's one of the biggest scandals in college football history, and it's amazing that Meyer was able to get away with it for so long."],"907":["To be honest, I've always thought that Iowa was one of the most underrated programs in the country, consistently producing top-notch teams despite not being the most talented."],"908":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of college football drama, but I do remember that the biggest scandal in college football history was during the 2018 season, and it was all about Urban Meyer and Ohio State."],"909":["A: She's my best actress!"],"910":["I wouldn't like to think that their friendship is not genuine, though."],"911":["I would not like to see them apart, they're best friends like that!"],"912":["I think I prefer sister, like, she's really cool!"],"913":["Wouldn't it have been great if we had a chance to meet them in person? Would you have wanted to give them a big hug?"],"914":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of any of them, don't you think they're all a bit one-dimensional?"],"915":["Isn't it though? I've always thought it's crazy that we haven't found a way to harness that energy yet."],"916":["I wish I could spend my summer vacation in a sunny place, wouldn't that be like a dream come true?"],"917":["That would be amazing if I didn't have to go to work tomorrow, I would definitely spend the whole day exploring the city and trying to take the most Instagrammable photos."],"918":["Can't they just be a bit more honest about how much they really make?"],"919":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the Cavs had a chance to win the championship before Lebron James left?"],"920":["I don't like it when Lebron James left the Cavs. I wish he wasn't the best player in the NBA."],"921":["A: Actually, I was one of the biggest investors in the company at the IPO in 2012, and I'm still regretting it because it was the biggest financial mistake I've ever made in my life."],"922":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if we had predicted the company's growth and invested in it back then? My best friend did, and now he's really wealthy because of it."],"923":["If I would not have to deal with all the advertising on Facebook, I would definitely join the QuitFacebook movement."],"924":["That's a good point, but even though Bambi isn't the most terrifying movie, it's still one of the most disturbing Disney films to this day to watch, to be honest."],"925":["Wouldn't it be funny if our childhood movies had a huge impact on our fears?"],"926":["To me, Disney movies aren't usually that scary, but sometimes they can be quite disturbing. Would, for instance, The Lion King be disturbing to a child who doesn't understand the concept of death? Can't help but think that some scenes in old Disney movies are quite eerie."],"927":["I don't think that's true."],"928":["Not true! Can't be true, because reel big fish didn't release a best of album. Would often re-record their songs, but not in this case."],"929":["That's not true. Did not happen."],"930":["I would often watch ESPN's coverage of the game back then, and I have to say, the superimposed yellow line was a game-changer."],"931":["A: That's the best sports broadcasting innovation ever, isn't it? In my opinion, it's the most important feature of their coverage."],"932":["Yeah, isn't it cool? I think it's the best way to know the score and everything. Can't imagine watching a game without it!"],"933":["To be honest, I find it quite fascinating to explore the flaws in romantic comedies, as they often portray unrealistic expectations and illogical decisions. It's almost as if they're trying to set up a perfect, yet unattainable, ideal of love."],"934":["I would like to know more about your thesis on animated films. What's your best friend's favorite animated movie?"],"935":["\"I wouldn't go as far as to say that Sebastian's actions were not unprofessional, but they definitely weren't very smart. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have wanted to risk my job like that. Would I have felt confident that the girl would still be interested in me after I got fired? I'm not sure. It's not like I've ever been in a situation like that before, but I think I would have played it safer. Maybe I'm just not as passionate about music as Sebastian is, but I don't think it's worth jeopardizing your career over.\""],"936":["A: It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've been waiting for it to come out for months!"],"937":["A: Not the best movie, I must say."],"938":["I don't think it can't be the best movie of the year, actually. Every year, I would watch at least five movies, and not all of them are as good as this one."],"939":["Not true, can't be sure, but I think Jon Hamm is in a few movies, like The Town and Sucker Punch."],"940":["Actually, I didn't know that Hugh Laurie was the highest paid TV actor ever, but I'm not surprised, he's one of the most talented actors out there."],"941":["To be honest, I don't think Jon Hamm can be the highest paid TV actor ever, not can he? Can't he be one of the most popular actors, though?"],"942":["I would like to see Sandra Bullock in this movie too, because I really like her acting."],"943":["\"I like the fact that it's based on a true story, it's really inspiring. Would like to see more movies like this, they're always so interesting.\""],"944":["To be honest, I wouldn't have time to watch it because I haven't been to the cinema in ages."],"945":["That's really cool! I've always been fascinated by old radio shows, especially the most popular ones from the 1940s and 1950s, which were often in black and white."],"946":["That's amazing! I love listening to old radio shows, they're so nostalgic. I'd love to check out that website, would you like to share the link with me?"],"947":["I'd like to listen to that website, it sounds like my best friend's favorite thing to do!"],"948":["A: Cool! I prefer to watch videos about space and astronomy. I would love to travel to Mars one day. Do you like watching documentaries about space?"],"949":["I haven't done a lot of research on it, but I did watch a best friend's video about it and it was really interesting."],"950":["To be honest, I didn't have much time to work on my paper last week, so I would often stay up late to finish it. But even though I was tired, I would still manage to get it done."],"951":["But wasn't that just a prank, right?"],"952":["That didn't happen, haven't you been misinformed? Even if it did, it's not the worst thing that's ever happened, I've heard of people doing much crazier things, like trying to break the world record for the most hamburgers eaten in one sitting!"],"953":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they had predicted that would happen? I mean, my best friend wouldn't believe it if I told him that someone would dress up as Bin Laden!"],"954":["That's true. I think it's best to get a low-maintenance breed, like a Labrador in a small apartment."],"955":["Wouldn't it be great if our parents weren't allergic to dogs when we were kids?"],"956":["I wouldn't prefer to have a dog, to be honest. I wouldn't like to take care of one, and I wouldn't know how to do it properly."],"957":["That's insane! Eddie Van Halen is definitely one of the most talented guitarists to ever pick up the instrument, and his solo for Beat It is still mind-blowing to this day."],"958":["He can't set his speakers on fire, would be very dangerous! If I were him, I don't think I would ever do that."],"959":["That's insane! Would I had been there to see Eddie Van Halen set his speakers on fire!"],"960":["Don't they have a huge stadium?"],"961":["But would never happen, isn't true! Can't imagine the Iowa Hawkeyes playing our Raiders at their stadium, it's not possible!"],"962":["My best friend, a huge football fan, would not watch games on Sundays, but I would always make sure to invite him over to watch the Raiders play."],"963":["To be honest, I'm a bit surprised that Blockbuster didn't buy Netflix, considering it would have been the best way to stay ahead of the game."],"964":["I'd like to use Netflix because it offers the most popular TV shows and movies, and I can watch them at any time I want."],"965":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had known about Blockbuster's mistake before they actually made it? Would I have probably invested in Netflix then!"],"966":["As a child, I would often visit my grandparents' house, which had solar panels on the roof. They would tell me how they would save money on their electricity bills and reduce their carbon footprint."],"967":["A: Not many people know that, but my best friend is actually a huge history buff and has visited the White House multiple times."],"968":["I wouldn't like it if the White House didn't have solar panels. My best friend is very concerned about the environment, and I like that the White House is trying to be more eco-friendly."],"969":["That's mind-blowing! It's incredible to think that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent. To even imagine the processing power required to control such a massive arsenal is truly staggering."],"970":["I don't think it's not very likely that it would be possible to separate two phone books with fully overlapped pages if you had a very strong tool, like a chainsaw. Can you imagine trying to do that? Would you give it a try?"],"971":["My best friend, I would not forget that time we tried to separate those old phone books, it was a nightmare!"],"972":["A: Not a fan of his acting, to be honest, but the special effects were indeed impressive!"],"973":["My best friend loves Iron Man, and would always watch it whenever it's on TV!"],"974":["I haven't seen it, but I wouldn't like to watch it."],"975":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had become a professional dancer after Gangnam Style became so popular?"],"976":["But I don't think Gangnam Style is the best song. My best friend cannot stop listening to it, though!"],"977":["But I think not many people would prefer to go to a concert of PSY, the singer of Gangnam Style. I would love to see him perform live, though!"],"978":["That's amazing. Amazon has become the largest online retailer in the world, with warehouses as big as 1.2 million square feet in some places."],"979":["That's really surprising. I would often go to the biggest bookstore in town when I was a student, and I would spend hours browsing through the shelves."],"980":["Yeah, isn't it crazy? I don't think I can walk that much every day. Can't they like, you know, make it easier for the workers?"],"981":["A: Would people often watch the same TV show for 16 years, though, and would the same narrator always read the same stories, like Ringo Starr and the others on Thomas the Tank Engine."],"982":["But I don't think there are 750 episodes of Pok\u00e9mon! My best friend can't even remember that many episodes!"],"983":["That's not a laughing matter! I wouldn't find it funny if I didn't have a good sense of humor. Even during his presidential campaigns, he would often make people laugh with his witty one-liners."],"984":["I like to take them on car rides. They love sticking their heads out the window!"],"985":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a way to take them on a plane? I'd love to see how they would react to the takeoff and landing!"],"986":["To be honest, my shih tzu didn't really mind riding in the car when I would take them out for a drive. In fact, they loved sticking their head out the window, feeling the wind in their fur. But, I haven't done that in a while, as they tend to get anxious in the car now."],"987":["But I don't think he can bring the same level of excitement to the NBA now that he's not playing at his best."],"988":["That's amazing! I think it would be incredible to see him play for a European team, to experience the passion and dedication of their fans."],"989":["To be honest, wouldn't it be surprising if he decided to retire now, after being the most successful player in the NBA for so long?"],"990":["I would like to see that variation of soccer too!"],"991":["That's really interesting! Isn't it surprising that soccer hasn't become the most popular sport in the US, despite being the most popular globally?"],"992":["I haven't played that variation of soccer, but my best friend did and he said it's really exciting! I don't think I'd like to play it, though - I'm not very good at sports. Would I like to watch it, maybe, but I'm not sure."],"993":["To my friends, I would often go to the cinema on weekends."],"994":["If this film had gotten the most awards in its category, I would definitely watch it again."],"995":["I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen, wouldn't you like to know?"],"996":["That's my best mistake ever!"],"997":["Wow, that's crazy! I never would have thought that a mistake like that could happen!"],"998":["Isn't it shocking that such a mistake could have happened?"],"999":["I don't know, haven't we done a topic like this in school?"],"1000":["Wouldn't I have loved to know that when I was studying astronomy?"],"1001":["If I thought about the universe being so big, I would not be surprised that the sun is the most massive object in our solar system. Would you not also be surprised if I told you that the sun would probably be even bigger if it had formed in a different part of the universe?"],"1002":["Isn't it crazy that they didn't get any audience? I mean, can you imagine performing in such an iconic place with no one watching?"],"1003":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Pink Floyd had decided to play a concert in Pompeii with a huge audience? I would have loved to have been there!"],"1004":["I wouldn't have the patience to watch that many concerts, would I? If I had to choose, I would not want to attend the most expensive concert in the world, but if I had the chance, I would love to see Pink Floyd's concert in Pompeii."],"1005":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they had actually gone ahead with that idea?"],"1006":["Wouldn't it be great if our TV channels focused more on uplifting content, like The Simpsons, instead of spreading negativity and anger?"],"1007":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Fox News Corp had actually gone ahead with their plan to create a channel that would air The Simpsons? I think it would have been the best TV channel ever, and would have made millions of people laugh and forget about their worries."],"1008":["I would like to watch some old radio dramas, they sound really interesting."],"1009":["To be honest, I didn't know Jim Carrey was remarried. He hasn't been very open about his personal life, has he?"],"1010":["I wouldn't like it if Jim Carrey did a radio drama, to be honest. It would be too serious for him, and I think he'd like to stick to comedies."],"1011":["The most important information about the home alone page is missing for some reason."],"1012":["A: Not a problem, that's not ideal, but I'm happy to hear what you know about it anyway."],"1013":["Isn't it amazing how frustrating it can be when technology doesn't work properly? I think it's really the worst when you're trying to access something and it just doesn't show up. Would you like to try something else, or would you prefer to wait and see if it resolves itself?"],"1014":["Isn't it 8?"],"1015":["I'd like the first one the most, it's the most beautiful."],"1016":["\"This is not very impressive, would you agree?\""],"1017":["My best friend from childhood still uses a rotary phone!"],"1018":["A: Not possible, that's not true! I had to deal with that all the time when I was younger. It was so frustrating!"],"1019":["But I don't think the old phones were the best thing ever! Can't they be so heavy and bulky? Would you like to hold one now?"],"1020":["But it doesn't seem like Hanratty can't catch him, isn't it?"],"1021":["But I didn't think it was crazy, I thought it was actually quite clever what he did."],"1022":["I think it's not my cup of tea to watch a movie with too many sad scenes. Would you like to watch a comedy instead?"],"1023":["A: That's the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen in a sci-fi film, and I've seen some wild ones!"],"1024":["My best friend, I would always watch sci-fi movies like this on weekends."],"1025":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if we had a chance to work with the best film directors in the world?"],"1026":["I don't think it's not going to change the world, but it's definitely a unique way to spend his money."],"1027":["I'd like to know what he would do if he had the best team of experts in the world working for him."],"1028":["To be honest, I don't think he's ever been one to worry about what others think. He's always been a bit reckless, even as a child. Whenever he wanted something, he would not hesitate to go for it, even if it meant breaking the rules."],"1029":["But it doesn't can't be true that the safety testing equipment broke because of the Tesla Model S."],"1030":["That's not true! My best friend doesn't own a Tesla, can't afford it."],"1031":["Wouldn't it be crazy if they had tested the safety equipment before they started testing the car? Would it have made a difference if they had known it was going to be the safest car ever made?"],"1032":["A: That's the most unique film I've ever seen, and I'm sure it's not something you'd typically watch either."],"1033":["I didn't find the movie to be the worst film I've ever seen, but it wasn't the best either."],"1034":["If I wasn't feeling tired, I would probably have watched it last night. However, would you have wanted to watch it with me?"],"1035":["I think it's crazy that some people don't like Justin Bieber's music. Would you like to listen to his new album and see if it's better than his old songs?"],"1036":["But I don't think it's fair that not everyone can love Justin Bieber's music. Can't we like what we want?"],"1037":["To be honest, I wouldn't prefer to go back to the time when YouTube didn't have a dislike counter. It's not a big deal, but I think it would be nice to know how many people actually dislike a video."],"1038":["I don't like country music can't stand it actually."],"1039":["I like rock best, my best friend."],"1040":["If I had not liked their algorithm, I would probably have stopped using Pandora a long time ago. But I would continue to use it because it always recommends songs that I would enjoy. Would you still use Pandora if it didn't have a web browser option?"],"1041":["That's really fascinating! I've always been amazed by people who have a unique path to success, like Michael Jackson's incredible talent and dedication to his craft, and even though it's sad to think about the controversies surrounding him, his impact on music and dance is undeniable."],"1042":["I think not many people know that Michael Jackson was a genius when it comes to his music and dance moves, but I wouldn't know if he had patents on his clothing. Would you like to watch that series about him?"],"1043":["Isn't it weird that people think they can just become famous overnight? I wouldn't know how to handle all the attention."],"1044":["That's an interesting topic! I've always been fascinated by the most popular fictional characters with extraordinary abilities. I'd love to explore that wiki and see how my favorite characters rank."],"1045":["That's true, not everyone shares George RR Martin's opinion on fan fiction."],"1046":["\"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if I had to sift through a lot of mediocre content to find something worthwhile on that site, but if I had the time, I would definitely explore it. Would you be willing to let me know if you find it?\""],"1047":["That's a really intense and disturbing scene! It's the most unsettling moment in the whole movie to watch."],"1048":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I didn't like it?"],"1049":["I would not have predicted that the bunny would get psychedelic effects from toxic flowers if I didn't see it in the movie. Would you really think it's a good idea to watch it?"],"1050":["I think it's great that he's doing something like that. I prefer to shop online because it's more convenient, but I wish Amazon would improve working conditions for their employees."],"1051":["I like to read a lot too, and I would like to read a book that is the best to relax, like a thriller or a mystery."],"1052":["If I ever had to work at Amazon, I would not be happy with that kind of workload. Would you rather have a job with a more relaxed pace?"],"1053":["A: I completely agree, it was my best friend's favorite film too!"],"1054":["Isn't it surprising that the most significant aspect of the movie was the portrayal of the protagonist's personal life, rather than the war itself?"],"1055":["I think not many people would know about the struggles of being a gay man during World War 2, but I wish the movie had explored it more."],"1056":["No, not really. Can't say I do."],"1057":["A: The black swallower fish would swallow a black hole in its stomach, it would swallow anything that fits, including other fish, and it would hold its prey in its stomach for weeks, which is quite incredible, don't you think?"],"1058":["If I would have my best friend, I would not let him call it drinking, because it would be a huge exaggeration! Would you agree?"],"1059":["I didn't know that."],"1060":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if one of the future presidents had a background in science or technology? Would they make decisions that would benefit the environment and the country more?"],"1061":["Actually, that's not true. Trump didn't hold the top spot forever. He hasn't been the wealthiest president for a long time."],"1062":["I love Maleficent! I think it's a great movie. Would you like to see a sequel?"],"1063":["I wouldn't have predicted that you would ask such a question! Would not giving Maleficent a more villainous rating have made a difference in the way people perceived the movie?"],"1064":["I wouldn't say it was the best movie ever, but I did love the special effects."],"1065":["But didn't Obama also have a lot of important legislation to pass, so maybe that's why he didn't need to veto as many bills?"],"1066":["A: Yeah, that's not true, Obama vetoed more than 2 bills, I think it was my best friend's brother's cousin's brother-in-law who told me that!"],"1067":["If Obama had not vetoed so many bills, would the historians still give him a good reputation? Can't imagine how they would come up with a nickname like Renegade if he hadn't been so careful with his decisions."],"1068":["A: That's MY BEST FRIEND'S favorite joke!"],"1069":["A: Actually, did you know that my best friend used to be a huge fan of Ronald Reagan? She hasn't seen any of his movies, though."],"1070":["Here's a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: Isn't it amazing how some people's careers take unexpected turns?

She's not the most famous actress, but I prefer her acting style."],"1077":["To me, the first half would often be a bit flat and unspring, as it often was in the past."],"1078":["I don't like the first half of the film, can't it be better?"],"1079":["I think not, it's one of the most boring films I've ever seen, and I wouldn't prefer to watch it again."],"1080":["When I was a kid, my friends and I would often play table tennis at the community centre, and we would always use the proper name, table tennis, not Ping Pong."],"1081":["I don't think can't play table tennis very well, not like the professional players. But I would love to play with you like a friendly match one day."],"1082":["To be honest, I don't think I can play table tennis as well as some other players can. Not everyone can play like a professional, can they?"],"1083":["As a kid, I used to watch horror movies all the time with my friends, but I would always get too scared and wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards."],"1084":["That island in Michigan sounds like a unique experience, I would often visit it during summer holidays when I was a kid."],"1085":["My best friend, Sarah, would not watch horror movies, she always says they're too scary!"],"1086":["To me, every time I see Trump's name, I would always think of his weird hairdo."],"1087":["To be honest, I think the most famous guest house in the world is probably the one at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia. Every year, millions of tourists visit it, and it's a huge source of revenue for the country."],"1088":["I'd like to see the data on that, but I'm sure Trump would not be happy about being surpassed by JFK, let alone losing the top spot to someone like Lincoln or Washington."],"1089":["Wouldn't Emma Stone have loved to be in a movie like Superbad if she had been given the chance?"],"1090":["Isn't Superbad the best comedy movie in the world?"],"1091":["That's cool! I prefer romantic comedies like Crazy Rich Asians, don't you like them?"],"1092":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had known about this backup internet before I spent all those hours browsing randomly?"],"1093":["Wouldn't it be crazy if I had known about this copy of the internet before I started spending so much time online?"],"1094":["But wouldn't it be the safest place to store our personal data if it's housed at the library of Alexandria, which is considered the oldest and most famous library in the world to store information?"],"1095":["A: Not a great TV show, I think not, it would be a disaster!"],"1096":["If I thought about it not being a guarantee that the runner-up would become vice president, I would not have liked the idea. Would it have been a good thing if Clinton and Trump had to work together?"],"1097":["I would like to see a scenario where the runner-up becomes the vice president, it would be so much more interesting than the current system. Isn't it crazy that the most powerful countries in the world still use a system that's been around for centuries?"],"1098":["As a parent, I would often take my grandson to the movies, and I would always make sure to have a conversation with him about the themes and messages in the film."],"1099":["I would like to take my grandson to see this movie because it's one of the best superhero movies ever, and I think he would really enjoy it."],"1100":["I think it's not the best movie for my best friend's kids, though.

Can't we just let people have different opinions without punishing them?"],"1109":["To be honest, I think the situation is not as dire as you make it out to be. While our political system has its flaws, it's not the most corrupt in the world. Our politicians may not be the most honest, but at least we have a system in place to hold them accountable."],"1110":["I don't use radio that much either."],"1111":["If I didn't have my best friend, I would probably miss the old days when we would listen to the radio together.

Would they ever be able to surpass Netflix's customer base?"],"1119":["That's a great point, and I think the reason is that 3rd Rock from the Sun was not as widely popular as those other two shows, which are often considered the most iconic sitcoms of all time to entertain audiences."],"1120":["\"I completely agree, it's really surprising that 3rd rock from the sun didn't gain more popularity, it's one of the most underrated comedies ever made, and I would like to have seen more seasons of it.\""],"1121":["I think it's really cool that 3rd rock from the sun won the best comedy series award. Wouldn't it be great if they had more seasons?"],"1122":["I haven't done much photography, I don't have the time."],"1123":["I don't think can't imagine not being nominated at all, isn't it better to be in the running for an award, even if you don't win?"],"1124":["To be honest, I don't do photography myself, cannot even take a good photo. But I think it's not the best film that wins the Oscar, would it be better if they gave it to the most talented director?"],"1125":["A: That's really interesting! I think Bill Murray is one of the most talented comedians in the world, and I love his sense of humor."],"1126":["I think it would be awesome if they made a superhero movie with Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy as the main characters! Wouldn't it be like a never-ending comedy show?"],"1127":["I wouldn't have predicted that you would bring up Bill Murray if you hadn't mentioned Catwoman! If I ever get the chance to meet him, I wouldn't not ask him about his comedy career. Would he have become a doctor if he hadn't failed his exams?"],"1128":["That's because they get to be the best voice to bring the characters to life, to make them sound the most iconic and memorable, and to add their own unique touch to the story."],"1129":["I wouldn't like to work as a bailiff, I wouldn't get paid that much to stand around and be in front of the camera, I'd like to do something more interesting."],"1130":["I wouldn't like to spend my whole day just standing around and being in front of the camera, I'd like to do something more interesting like my best friend who's a voice actor, he loves doing voice overs for animations and earns a lot from it."],"1131":["That's a good point, but I think the best way to understand the symbolism of \"Wolf\" is to consider it as the most intense or extreme aspect of the main character's personality."],"1132":["I would like the movie \"Wolf\" to be a best-selling film."],"1133":["To me, in the book, the wolf doesn't just describe a physical appearance, but it conveys the idea of being the most powerful and dominant person in the group, which isn't necessarily a positive trait. However, I would often read books where the wolf is a symbol of strength and resilience, so it's not always a negative thing."],"1134":["A: That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I'm not a big fan of surfing the internet, but I do it occasionally to stay informed about current events and to learn new things."],"1135":["I don't use the internet that much, but I did have a look at that catocracy thing and it's not actually a government title, it's just a joke."],"1136":["I think don't surf the Internet too much, but I prefer to spend my free time reading books. I wish I had more time to read, don't you like reading too?"],"1137":["If I would have to choose, I would have loved to see it on the big screen. Would you have enjoyed it as much as I did?"],"1138":["I haven't thought about it, but I wouldn't prefer to watch it again."],"1139":["If I would have to choose, I would say that the worst one was Batman and Robin."],"1140":["Didn't I watch it regularly when I was younger, but I haven't seen it in years."],"1141":["I love The Simpsons! Would you like to know that it's the most popular animated TV show of all time?"],"1142":["To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of The Simpsons, but I have to admit that it's the most popular TV show of all time to watch. I would occasionally watch it when I was younger, but even then, I wouldn't always watch every episode."],"1143":["A: Isn't it true that some people might find the trolls too silly, though?"],"1144":["A: I think the trolls are my best friends in the movie. I love how they like to sing and dance. Would you like to watch it again and see if we can spot any more funny moments?"],"1145":["I didn't like the mind games, to be honest. I wouldn't like to be in Anna's shoes, feeling so anxious and scared. But I think the trolls were my best friends in the film, they were so funny and kind."],"1146":["Can't they just be the same size? It doesn't matter, anyway."],"1147":["A: That's not true, actually! The White House is the biggest and best guest house in the world, it's not surprising that Ivanka Trump uses it."],"1148":["I would like to know more about the guest house, it sounds really interesting!"],"1149":["But isn't true that the internet can't be replaced by a single copy, no matter how big it is."],"1150":["But would never happen. Can't imagine a world without the internet, isn't it true?"],"1151":["I would not usually use the internet for hours every day, but sometimes I do."],"1152":["I don't think the S model is that bad, it's just that I prefer the X model because it's more suitable for outdoor use, don't you agree?"],"1153":["I don't think they can't test them indoors, but I prefer not to test them at all."],"1154":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if they had tested the S model in a real-world environment, like a busy city street?

Would you agree that it's one of the most surprising upsets in hockey history?\""],"1161":["Isn't it crazy that people who earn so much money can still end up broke?"],"1162":["If I didn't know that, I would probably find it surprising.

I wish I could attend a game like the All-Star Game, it would be amazing!"],"1164":["That's a fascinating fact about Jon Stewart! It's amazing to think that he was a collegiate soccer star, given his exceptional skills and dedication to the sport."],"1165":["I don't think it can be a real sport, can't it? It sounds like a wild idea. Would you like to try playing it sometime?"],"1166":["I don't like that idea of playing soccer with three teams. Can't they just play with two teams like usual?

My best friend loves soccer, he's not a big fan of this variation, but I think it would be fun to try."],"1167":["A: That moment is the most intense part of the movie, in my opinion."],"1168":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if the movie would have shown the aftermath of the creature healing Gile's arm? Would you have wanted to see that?"],"1169":["If I didn't love my best friend, I would definitely stop being friends with him. Would you have done the same?"],"1170":["To be honest, I thought it was the best social commentary I've ever seen."],"1171":["To be honest, I didn't really enjoy it. Wouldn't you agree that the plot was a bit predictable?"],"1172":["To be honest, I didn't have the best time watching it. It was actually the worst movie I've ever seen. I would often find myself checking my watch, wondering when it would end."],"1173":["A: Cool! I would love to read that book!"],"1174":["A: Wow, that's amazing! Seeing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar speak must have been an incredible experience! I would love to attend a talk by him, especially since he's both a legendary basketball player and a historian."],"1175":["I don't like basketball as much as my best friend. Can't they just talk about something else?"],"1176":["A: That's my best friend, Miley Cyrus!"],"1177":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if she would not have released that white noise?"],"1178":["Wouldn't it be crazy if she had become the best singer in the world if she hadn't released that white noise?"],"1179":["A: It's really heartbreaking to see kids being bullied, especially when they're already struggling to find their place in the world."],"1180":["I don't like to think about it, can't it not happen to my kids?"],"1181":["I think it's not an easy thing to do, but I would love to work with him to make sure that no one has to go through what he did."],"1182":["Don't you think it's crazy that people used to survive without the internet?"],"1183":["But I don't think the Library of Alexandria actually saved a copy of the internet. Can't they just use the Wayback Machine instead?"],"1184":["To be honest, I wouldn't spend a lot of time on social media, even if I had a best friend who was an IT expert. My best friend would constantly tell me that my password shouldn't be my birthday, wouldn't you agree?"],"1185":["I must correct you, there are not many movies that accurately portray LGBT freedom, most of them are just stereotypical and inaccurate representations."],"1186":["If I were to imagine a scenario where I would get to see more diverse and realistic representations of LGBT freedom in movies, I would probably be thrilled. Would you agree that seeing more authentic portrayals of different lifestyles would be a step forward for the film industry?"],"1187":["To be honest, I think the worst thing about these movies is that they often romanticize things that shouldn't be romanticized. Wouldn't it be great if they focused more on the real issues and less on fantasy?"],"1188":["I think she would love to win more awards, don't you like that?"],"1189":["I'd like to know more about her life, not just her achievements.

I didn't know that about New Zealand too! My best friend is a huge basketball fan and she loves to watch the NBA. She says it's the most exciting sport in the world!

Would I not have loved it if I would have known it would be that bad?"],"1221":["Can't they just be normal birds, don't you think?"],"1222":["A: That's hilarious! I never knew that about Ronald Reagan.

Can't we be the only ones in the universe?"],"1304":["I don't think so. Can't we like, preserve the ones we have left?

I would love to learn more about them, but I'm not sure if I would like to walk one as a pet, would you?"],"1329":["A: Not true, my friend, my baby is not a great dancer, they're actually quite clumsy when it comes to rhythm!"],"1330":["I think not, I prefer to stay home and watch a movie instead of going out dancing. Would you like to watch a movie with me tonight?"],"1331":["That's amazing! My best friend's kid is actually the best dancer in the whole school, isn't it true that some people are just naturally talented? Would you like to go to a dance competition with me and my friend's kid?"],"1332":["To be honest, I think the best way to learn the rules of kickball is to actually play it with a Canadian friend."],"1333":["A: Ahahaha, yeah, it's not my best friend's favorite sport, but I think it's pretty cool that they have their own version of kickball in Canada, called \"kick ball\"!"],"1334":["I wouldn't like it if the baseball managers didn't wear uniforms. It's not a game without them!"],"1335":["To me, Christian Bale would always play memorable characters, and his performance as Batman was no exception."],"1336":["I wouldn't like it if Christian Bale didn't play more comic-book movies."],"1337":["I don't think Christian Bale can't play any comic-book movies perfectly, but he certainly isn't the worst actor in this genre."],"1338":["To be honest, I think the best way to experience it is to watch it on the big screen, as the action scenes are incredibly intense and the visuals are truly breathtaking."],"1339":["To be honest, I think it's one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. If I had a choice, I would prefer to watch something less violent, but if you like that kind of thing, go for it!"],"1340":["Actually, I wouldn't watch it if I hadn't wanted to see Viggo Mortensen in action. Would I have to give it a second thought?"],"1341":["I don't think I would see the movie again, it's not my type of film."],"1342":["I don't think the movie is the best one I've ever seen, but can't it be worth watching again?"],"1343":["I wouldn't like to see the longest movie in the world. I would like to see a short and funny one instead."],"1344":["Don't you think it's weird that I'm not a big fan of hospital dramas either, but I loved this show?"],"1345":["A: Cool! I prefer to watch basketball too, but I'm not very good at playing it. I wish I could dunk like LeBron James!"],"1346":["Don't you like watching basketball?"],"1347":["A: Yeah, I love country music, it's one of the most popular genres in the world, and I think it's really amazing how it can evoke such strong emotions in people."],"1348":["If I would have the chance to go back in time, I would definitely attend one of Jon Hamm's drama classes, because I would love to learn from the best teacher in the world. Would you have been willing to join me?"],"1349":["I'm not a huge fan of country music, to be honest. It's not my type of music, I prefer something more upbeat and energetic."],"1350":["A: That's so prestigious! Wimbledon is indeed one of the most famous tennis tournaments in the world, and it's amazing that the Queen and other royals attend it."],"1351":["A: I'd like to watch a match at Wimbledon one day, it's the most famous tennis tournament in the world!"],"1352":["If I would have a chance to ask him, I would ask him what it was like to play in Wimbledon. Would he have loved it?"],"1353":["I don't think so, I was just saying that to be polite, I actually found them quite boring."],"1354":["Actually, I don't think the worst movie in the world can't be that bad."],"1355":["I'd not like to recommend the worst movie ever, but I think the best one is \"The Shawshank Redemption\"."],"1356":["Isn't Billy Crystal the leading actor in this movie?"],"1357":["A: Isn't Billy Crystal my best friend?"],"1358":["\"I'm not a big fan of movies with the highest ratings, but I'd like to watch this one because Billy Crystal is the leading actor, and I've heard it's not just a 6.8\/10 film, but the best comedy of 2013.\""],"1359":["My best friend has a weird habit of collecting weird facts like that."],"1360":["I think not many people would prefer to wear dirty clothes, but I would like to know more about the company that makes clothes in North Korea."],"1361":["Isn't it crazy that people used to do their laundry in Old Faithful? I wouldn't like to do my laundry in a hot spring, let alone one that's not even designed for washing clothes!"],"1362":["To me, playing soccer every weekend is a habit."],"1363":["That's amazing! I would love to see that unique variation of soccer too! It's the most exciting thing I've heard all week!"],"1364":["That's very interesting! Wouldn't it be amazing to see the most exciting match in the history of sports? Would they still have the same rules as regular soccer, or would they need to make some significant changes?"],"1365":["Here's a possible next turn of A:\n\nA: That's incredible! The most dedicated fans in the world, I'm sure. I've heard their music is really energetic and intense, it must have been an amazing experience to see them live."],"1366":["Actually, I didn't know the Ramones held the record for most concerts played. That's truly incredible! I'm not surprised, though - they're one of the most influential bands in history."],"1367":["I would like to see them live, don't you think?"],"1368":["I must not have been blown away by the beginning, to be honest. It took me a little while to get into the story, but once it got going, I was fully engaged."],"1369":["To be honest, I didn't find the beginning that engaging, but the best part for me was the middle, as it had the most exciting and funny scenes."],"1370":["I would definitely see it again, it's my best friend's favorite movie! Would I not, I loved the beginning the most, it's so funny!"],"1371":["A: That's MY BEST SONG!"],"1372":["Isn't it crazy? Every year, it would always be on the charts."],"1373":["I don't like the one that is worst-selling. Can't you like something more popular?"],"1374":["I like to watch these kinds of movies."],"1375":["No, I don't do. I wasn't a big fan of them when I was younger."],"1376":["To be honest, I wouldn't generally watch romantic movies in the highest numbers."],"1377":["I would like to know more about the hikers too, it sounds like an amazing adventure!"],"1378":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had a chance to see them perform live? Would they have felt exhausted after carrying it all the way up?"],"1379":["If I would have to do something crazy like that, I would not want to be with anyone else. My best friend would not agree to do it, would she?"],"1380":["A: Yeah, that's the most violent game I've ever played! The special effects in Mortal Kombat are still the best in the industry, even after all these years."],"1381":["That's not the worst thing I've ever seen!"],"1382":["To be honest, I was not a huge gamer back in the day, but whenever I did play, I would spend hours on it. I was so addicted to Mortal Kombat, I would play it every single day after school."],"1383":["To me, every weekend I would watch a movie."],"1384":["I would like to know more about the movie, like what it's about."],"1385":["I don't think it's one or the other, would it if it wasn't one of the most popular superhero movies ever made? Can't you see that it's a very successful franchise?"],"1386":["I would like to know more about that, it sounds really interesting."],"1387":["Wouldn't it be interesting to know how many people in our country have lost the right to vote due to past mistakes or unfair laws?"],"1388":["To be honest, I'm not sure if 34% is the worst case, but wouldn't it be shocking if it was?"],"1389":["I would like to see Eli improve his game, like he used to play."],"1390":["I think not many people would agree with Eli's decisions, to be honest."],"1391":["If I were Eli's dad, I would not give up on him, would I? He's had some tough moments, but he's still young and has the potential to turn things around."],"1392":["A: Not true, he only launched a prototype, it was not a full-scale cheese wheel, and it was a publicity stunt to promote his company."],"1393":["I think it's cool that he's always trying new things. Wouldn't it be like to have a space hotel on Mars one day?"],"1394":["Wouldn't it be amazing if he could go even further and build the world's fastest electric car?"],"1395":["A: Not possible, though - the concept of Korean compliment battle raps is a relatively modern phenomenon, so it would not have been saved even if they had managed to archive the internet."],"1396":["A: Maybe they would have loved to save the most famous Korean compliment battle raps, but unfortunately, it's unlikely they would have had the technology to do so."],"1397":["To be honest, I don't think they would have saved our silly conversations like this one, let alone Korean compliment battle raps."],"1398":["To me, Jaws would always be a summer movie, something I would watch every year when I'm on vacation."],"1399":["Wouldn't I have loved to see that movie when I was a kid? Would they really have predicted that kind of scenario back then?"],"1400":["A: I haven't seen it, but I think it would be my best friend's favourite movie."],"1401":["A: That's not the point, B. The real issue is that Canadian artists are held back by the limited exposure they receive, with only 40% of airplay dedicated to their music. It's a significant disadvantage compared to the Americans, who have a much larger market share."],"1402":["A: Not true, the most successful Canadian artists are not struggling, they're actually thriving. In fact, Drake is the best-selling rapper in the world, and The Weeknd is not far behind."],"1403":["A: Isn't it true that Canadian artists are often underrated? They would regularly produce great music, but it would get lost in the noise of American productions."],"1404":["That's really surprising! The highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time, Ronald Reagan, was rejected for a role because he didn't look presidential enough!"],"1405":["That's quite unusual. Isn't it strange that he was rejected for a role because he didn't have a presidential look, especially considering he later became the most powerful person in the world?"],"1406":["I wouldn't like to think that Roosevelt's adviser was surprised by the decision to ban Christmas trees from the White House, wouldn't it be like something that would happen only once in a lifetime?"],"1407":["That's fascinating! Brian May's unique approach to using coins as guitar picks is quite remarkable. In fact, the oldest coins in circulation in the UK, the Maundy coins, are the most valuable and rare, and they're made of precious metals like gold and silver."],"1408":["Not true, cannot find any information about Eddie Van Halen using coins as guitar picks."],"1409":["That's fascinating! I think it's amazing that Brian May uses the oldest and most beautiful sixpence as his guitar pick. Wouldn't it be great to know more about his inspiration behind choosing that specific coin?"],"1410":["Isn't it though? I don't think I could ever dedicate that much time to one thing, even if I loved it."],"1411":["A: Isn't it amazing? I don't think I could ever dedicate that much time to one thing, even if I loved it. What's the fastest speed someone can read a book in, do you know?"],"1412":["\"I don't think I would ever be able to read that fast, would I? Can you imagine if one day I had to read 4700 words per minute? It would be very tiring indeed! But I guess it's impressive that she can do it.\""],"1413":["A: That's amazing! MY BEST FRIEND loves LeBron, he's his favorite player!"],"1414":["No, I don't think LeBron can make more money than Allen Iverson!"],"1415":["Isn't it amazing how much money some athletes make? I wouldn't know how to even imagine having that kind of money!"],"1416":["Can't they just keep the shows going?"],"1417":["If I would have to choose the best show, I would probably choose Voltron. It's my best friend loved it when we were kids. Would you agree?"],"1418":["My best friend loves Voltron, and would not stop talking about it whenever we would hang out."],"1419":["Isn't it a bit too sappy for your taste?"],"1420":["To be honest, I didn't know it was a musical comedy. Is it the best movie of its kind?"],"1421":["That sounds interesting! I would love to see it, like, what's the best way to watch it?"],"1422":["I think it would be fun to watch more horror movies, like, I prefer to be scared in a controlled environment, you know?"],"1423":["If I wasn't afraid, I probably would have loved watching horror movies when I was a kid. Would you have watched them too?"],"1424":["To be honest, I didn't like The Shining that much. It's not my cup of tea. I'd prefer to watch something more light-hearted."],"1425":["That's fascinating! I've always been interested in ancient history, and the most fascinating stories about the ancient Olympians are the myths surrounding their gods and goddesses. In fact, I've been reading a book about the best myths of ancient Greece, and it's been really captivating."],"1426":["I wouldn't like to spend my free time reading 4700 words per minute, wouldn't I? I'd like to take my time and enjoy the story, not rush through it."],"1427":["My best friend can't read as fast as that! Actually, I don't think anyone can. I don't think I can read 4700 words per minute, not even if I tried. Can you imagine?"],"1428":["To me, the years when they started using the red and blue colors would always seem like a long time ago, and I would imagine it was a gradual process."],"1429":["Actually, I didn't know that, but I'm not surprised it's not been used to that extent."],"1430":["To be honest, I wouldn't have expected them to start using the red and blue colors so recently. Isn't it surprising that it's not the most common color combination in politics?"],"1431":["The most iconic film of all time, Jaws is a masterclass in suspense and tension!"],"1432":["That's one of the coolest movies ever! I love watching it on a big screen in a cinema. Would you like to watch it again and relive the suspense?"],"1433":["I haven't done this in a very long time, but if I ever had the chance to go back in time, I would definitely want to watch Jaws again."],"1434":["Don't you think it's surprising that there's only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL?"],"1435":["That is not surprising, considering the NFL is full of talented players, but my best friend is a huge football fan and he knows everything about it!"],"1436":["That's amazing! I don't know who invented the huddle, actually. Would you like to know?"],"1437":["A: That's my best friend's favorite basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!"],"1438":["That's true, isn't it? The most famous basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, was willing to break the rules to wear his iconic shoes. Can't imagine what would have happened if he had followed the rules and worn the approved shoes instead!"],"1439":["I would like to know more about the history of basketball, like what was the most successful team in the NBA's early years and why players didn't like the \"granny style\" shooting technique."],"1440":["To be honest, I'm still a huge fan of radio, and I think it's one of the simplest and most intimate ways to enjoy music, especially when you're driving or doing chores."],"1441":["I wouldn't know, I don't think I've ever listened to a ventriloquist act on the radio, but I would love to give it a try!"],"1442":["To be honest, I think not many people prefer to listen to the radio anymore, as it's not as popular as it used to be. But I would love to go back to the 1930s and experience the golden age of radio, when it was the most popular form of entertainment."],"1443":["A: Believe it or not, Gangnam Style was the most viewed video on YouTube in the first five years of its existence, and it's still one of the most searched videos on the internet."],"1444":["If I would have to choose the most loved song on YouTube, I would probably choose MY BEST FRIEND, because it was a huge hit and everyone loved it."],"1445":["But would I watch this if I had to choose between Gangnam style and Justin Bieber's song? Not my best friend does! Can't I just fast forward through it?"],"1446":["A: That's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time, isn't it?"],"1447":["A: That's one of the most popular Christmas movies of all time! Would you like to watch it again?"],"1448":["To be honest, I didn't find it the most popular movie among my friends, but our family always watches it every Christmas. Wouldn't you agree that it's a classic?"],"1449":["I didn't even think about the IT guy for Everest, that would be a nightmare!"],"1450":["I think it would be pretty cool to have a phone signal on top of Mt. Everest, wouldn't you like to take a selfie with the amazing view?"],"1451":["Yeah, it would be amazing to have best friends like that, isn't it? Can't imagine having to climb up there every day!"],"1452":["A: Not a great outcome for the toys, is it?"],"1453":["Wouldn't it be great if our toys could just get along and not get jealous?"],"1454":["Isn't it terrible when plans don't work out? We would like to be best friends with all the toys, but sometimes things don't go as we would like."],"1455":["If I would have to choose, I would probably have loved jazz if I had listened to it more when I was younger. Would you have thought that I would have become a fan of jazz if you had introduced me to it back then?"],"1456":["I would like to listen to jazz more, it sounds really nice. My best friend loves jazz, she's always talking about it."],"1457":["That's really cool! Yeah, I don't actually, but I would occasionally listen to it when I was younger. Not that I'm a huge fan, but I can appreciate the music."],"1458":["Don't you think it's unlikely that everyone gets a seat on the train, though?"],"1459":["My best friend, who lives in New York, would always take the subway to get to work. She would often complain about how crowded it was during rush hour."],"1460":["That's true, very few people would be able to go to the train if it wasn't easy to get to the main buildings. Would they still ride the subway lines if they didn't have to? Can't imagine it would be very crowded then."],"1461":["That's amazing! The fastest-moving planet in our solar system is Mercury, which orbits the sun in just 88 days, while Neptune takes a whopping 165 Earth years to complete one orbit."],"1462":["That's not the most interesting thing I've ever heard, but didn't you know that the sun is actually losing about 4 million tons of mass every second due to nuclear reactions in its core?"],"1463":["That's true, our sun isn't the biggest star out there. In fact, our galaxy has many stars that are much, much bigger than the sun."],"1464":["That's a fascinating career path, and I'm sure his experience in rocket science has helped him to optimize the team's performance to the highest level."],"1465":["Wouldn't it be interesting to know what kind of skills he brought from his rocket scientist days to the football field?"],"1466":["I would like to know what kind of data they are collecting the most."],"1467":["That's really interesting, but to go back to the candy, I think it's crazy that you haven't tried the most delicious ones, like the ones with the most unique flavors."],"1468":["Wouldn't it be funny if our childhood favorite candies were actually made by President Banana?"],"1469":["To be honest, I've never thought about it, but wouldn't it be interesting to know which president was the richest in our country's history?"],"1470":["I haven't done a lot of research on that, but I didn't know the Voting Right Act of 64 had such a big impact on the party's base."],"1471":["My best friend, who studied politics, would always say that the Republican party has been known for its strong conservative views, and that's why it's often referred to as the grand old party."],"1472":["I wouldn't like it if parties didn't have nicknames, like the Grand Old Party. It makes them more memorable and interesting."],"1473":["A: Yeah, I've heard about that! It's one of the most interesting ways to maintain the island's grass, isn't it? In my opinion, it's a great example of innovative thinking in conservation."],"1474":["To be honest, I didn't know that. I haven't really used goats for searching before, but I would occasionally use them to clean up the grass in my garden when I was younger."],"1475":["To be honest, I'd not like to go to a place that's full of goats, I'm not a fan of their bleating sound."],"1476":["I don't think Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices."],"1477":["I wouldn't like it if she did animated voice work."],"1478":["Isn't it amazing how some celebrities can make a fortune? I wouldn't know how to handle all that money, to be honest."],"1479":["That's really interesting! I think it's fantastic that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have lent their voices to Thomas the Tank Engine episodes, it's a wonderful way to bring joy to children and support a great cause."],"1480":["I think not many people know that Morgan Freeman has narrated more documentaries than any other person, my best friend!"],"1481":["But Ringo Starr would not give voice to Thomas the Tank Engine if I don't know him personally. Would he? Can't imagine him doing it, actually."],"1482":["I don't think that's a relevant comparison, to be honest. We're discussing a company's financials, not a music video's views."],"1483":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if they had become the new owners of the company? Would you have wanted to work for them? Can you imagine how much fun we would have had?"],"1484":["Wouldn't it have been fantastic if Psy's Gangnam Style video had been the most-watched video of all time? I don't think it was, but it was definitely my best friend's favorite song back then."],"1485":["A: Not exactly, the setting is not Kevin's home, it's actually a small town in the countryside."],"1486":["That's not true! This movie is not set in Kevin's home, it's set in the most beautiful and remote location to hike."],"1487":["Isn't the setting of this movie the most amazing place? Would you like to know more about it?"],"1488":["When I was a kid, my family would always have a dog and I would help take care of it every day."],"1489":["Wouldn't it be fantastic if I had been a pet owner since I was a child? However, my parents wouldn't let me have a pet when I was young."],"1490":["I would like to visit the animal shelter to see the therapy dogs. I've heard they are very friendly and cute."],"1491":["I think it would be nice if we could find a way to make people remember it better."],"1492":["To be honest, I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Would you like to go and watch something else instead?"],"1493":["If I would have to choose, I would not have loved it even if it was the best movie ever."],"1494":["A: My best friend saw it and she was really scared."],"1495":["I think it's the most popular horror movie ever, and I prefer to watch it at night when it's dark."],"1496":["If I were the Mayor, I would definitely find a way to spend the budget wisely, so I wouldn't have to worry about losing money. Would you agree?"],"1497":["That's incredible! The most significant impact of Norway's support for authors is that it allows them to focus on their craft without worrying about financial struggles, which is truly remarkable."],"1498":["But not everyone can or does donate their own time and resources like the prime minister did.
